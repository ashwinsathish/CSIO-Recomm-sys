There are also some movies in dataset, that they really less ratings count. That's why it would be better, if we throw out them and continue with common movies. So, we define rare and common movies. We create a list as rating_counts, see how they are distributed and take the limit quantile 90% for common movies. Finally create a table which users watched which movies. Here is important to understand table, because we take our users to the index and the columns for movies.
