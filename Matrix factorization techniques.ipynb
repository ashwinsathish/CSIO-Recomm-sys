The factors L and U are triangular matrices. The factorization that comes from elimination is A = LU. A variation of this decomposition that is numerically more stable to solve in practice is called the LUP decomposition, or the LU decomposition with partial pivoting. The rows of the parent matrix are re-ordered to simplify the decomposition process and the additional P matrix specifies a way to permute the result or return the result to the original order."],"metadata":{"id":"dTSWFhqm_bPF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# LU decomposition\n","from numpy import array\n","from scipy.linalg import lu\n","\n","A = array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n","print(A)\n","print(\"\\n\")\n","\n","P, L, U = lu(A)\n","\n","print(P)\n","print(\"\\n\")\n","print(L)\n","print(\"\\n\")\n","print(U)\n","print(\"\\n\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EQU5SNSl-9AT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1654837281052,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN SATHISH KUMAR","userId":"16573036374703807472"}},"outputId":"ad6fcd0e-8e54-4760-9852-192dddc3e639"},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[[1 2 3]\n"," [4 5 6]\n"," [7 8 9]]\n","\n","\n","[[0. 1. 0.]\n"," [0. 0. 1.]\n"," [1. 0. 0.]]\n","\n","\n","[[1.         0.         0.        ]\n"," [0.14285714 1.         0.        ]\n"," [0.57142857 0.5        1.        ]]\n","\n","\n","[[7.         8.         9.        ]\n"," [0.         0.85714286 1.71428571]\n"," [0.         0.         0.        ]]\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## QR Decomposition\n"],"metadata":{"id":"i8fpLAHAADlu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# QR decomposition\n","from numpy import array\n","from numpy.linalg import qr\n","\n","A = array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n","print(A)\n","print(\"\\n\")\n","\n","Q, R = qr(A, 'complete')\n","print(Q)\n","print(\"\\n\")\n","print(R)\n","print(\"\\n\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FgnyDAd9AHlp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1654837539212,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":482,"user":{"displayName":"ASHWIN SATHISH KUMAR","userId":"16573036374703807472"}},"outputId":"8f43d590-29c6-40d5-cd23-cbb6ccec9c82"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[[1 2]\n"," [3 4]\n"," [5 6]]\n","\n","\n","[[-0.16903085  0.89708523  0.40824829]\n"," [-0.50709255  0.27602622 -0.81649658]\n"," [-0.84515425 -0.34503278  0.40824829]]\n","\n","\n","[[-5.91607978 -7.43735744]\n"," [ 0.          0.82807867]\n"," [ 0.          0.        ]]\n","\n","\n"]}]}]}
