Health service delivery in China a literature review /,Finance,"""The authors report the results of a review of the Chinese-language and English-language literatures on service delivery in China, asking how well China's health care providers perform, what determines their performance, and how the government can improve it.  They find current performance leaves room for improvement in terms of quality, responsiveness to patients, efficiency, cost escalation, and equity.  The literature suggests that these problems will not be solved by simply shifting ownership to the private sector, or by simply encouraging providers-public and private-to compete with one another for individual patients.  In contrast, substantial improvements could be (and in some places have already been) made by changing the way providers are paid-shifting away from fee-for-service and the distorted price schedule toward prospective payments.  Active purchasing by insurers could further improve outcomes. ""--World Bank web site."
A review of the empirical literature on FDI determinants,Economic theory,"""This paper surveys the recent burgeoning literature that empirically examines the foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and the resulting aggregate location of FDI across the world.  The contribution of the paper is to evaluate what we can say with relative confidence about FDI as a profession, given the evidence, and what we cannot have much confidence in at this point.  Suggestions are made for future research directions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A literature review on the effectiveness of financial education,Economic theory,"""This survey summarizes current research on financial literacy efforts. Because most financial literacy programs are relatively new, much of the literature reviewed here is also new and part of a field that is still developing as a program of research. However, we can conclude that financial education is necessary and that many existing approaches are effective. Among the findings are that some households make mistakes with personal finance decisions; mistakes are more common for low income and less educated households; there is a causal connection between increases in financial knowledge and financial behavior; and the benefits of financial education appear to span a number of areas including retirement planning, savings, homeownership, and credit use.""--Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond web site."

Perspectives from the happiness literature and the role of new instruments for policy analysis,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""After having been ignored for a long time by economists, happiness is becoming an object of serious research in 21st century economics. In Section 2 we sketch the present status of happiness economics. In Section 3 we consider the practical applicability of happiness economics, retaining the assumption of ordinal individual utilities. In Section 4 we introduce a cardinal utility concept, which seems to us the natural consequence of the happiness economics methodology. In Section 5 we sketch how this approach can lead to a normative approach to policy problems that is admissible from a positivist point of view. Section 6 concludes""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
How can behavioral economics inform non-market valuation? an example from the preference reversal literature /,Economic theory,"""Psychological insights have made inroads within most major areas of study in economics.  One area where less advance has been made is environmental and resource economics.  In this study, we examine the implications of preference reversals over evaluation modes, in which stated economic values critically depend on whether the good is valued jointly with others or in isolation.  The question arises because two commonly used methods for eliciting stated preferences differ in that one presents objects together and another presents objects to be evaluated in isolation.  Beyond showing an example of the import of behavioral economics, our empirical evidence sheds new light on the factors associated with insensitivity of valuations to the scope of the good""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Emerging infrastructure policy issues in developing countries a survey of the recent economic literature /,Finance,"""Estache reviews the recent economic research on emerging issues for infrastructure policies affecting poor people in developing countries.  His main purpose is to identify some of the challenges the international community, and donors in particular, are likely to have to address over the next few years.  He addresses six main issues: (1) the necessity of infrastructure in achieving the Millennium Development Goals; (2) the various dimensions of financing challenges for infrastructure; (3) the debate on the relative importance of urban and rural infrastructure needs; (4) the debate on the effectiveness of infrastructure decentralization; (5) what works and what does not when trying to target the needs of the poor, with an emphasis on affordability and regulation challenges; and (6) the importance of governance and corruption in the sector.  The author concludes by showing how the challenges identified define a relatively well integrated agenda for both researchers and the international infrastructure community.  This paper,a product of the Office of the Vice President, Infrastructure Network,is part of a larger effort in the network to stimulate more analytical assessments of emerging issues in the sector""--World Bank web site."

"Decreasing delinquency, criminal behavior, and recidivism by intervening on psychological factors other than cognitive ability a review of the intervention literature /",Economic theory,"""Research on the causes of delinquency has a long research history, often with an undue focus on how cognitive ability serves as the main predictor of delinquent activity.  The current review examines interventions that focus on psychological factors other than cognitive ability, and discusses how several of these programs have demonstrated efficacy in reducing delinquent behavior.  Our review uncovers certain themes shared by a number of effective interventions.  First, these interventions tend to emphasize rigorous and consistent implementation.  Second, effective interventions often incorporate the family environment.  Third, several effective interventions have focused on promoting adaptive social skills.  In conclusion, our review discusses the possibility that these interventions have proven efficacious in part because they promote adaptive personality trait development""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Theories of statistical discrimination and affirmative action a survey /,Economic theory,"""This chapter surveys the theoretical literature on statistical discrimination and affirmative action.  This literature suggests different explanations for the existence and persistence of group inequality.  This survey highlights such differences and describes in these contexts the effects of color-sighted and color-blind affirmative action policies, and the efficiency implications of discriminatory outcomes""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Explaining enterprise performance in developing countries with business climate survey data,Finance,"""This paper surveys the recent literature which examines the impact of business climate variables on productivity and growth in developing countries using enterprise surveys.  Comparable enterprise surveys today cover some 70,000 firms in over 100 countries around the world.  The literature that has analyzed this data provides evidence that a good business climate drives growth by encouraging investment and higher productivity.  Various infrastructure, finance, security, competition and regulation variables have been shown to significantly impact firm performance.  Section 1 of this paper outlines the theoretical framework that underpins the investment climate literature.  Section 2 describes the available datasets and surveys the key findings of the empirical literature, first macroeconomic and then microeconomic studies.  Particular attention is paid to the robustness of the reported results.  Section 3 highlights important econometric issues common to this literature and suggests a research agenda and possible improvements in survey design. ""--World Bank web site."

Personnel economics,Economic theory,"""In this review of the personnel economics literature, we introduce key topics of personnel economics, focus on some relatively new findings that have emerged since prior reviews of some or all of the personnel economics literature, and suggest open questions in personnel economics where future research can make valuable contributions to the literature.  We explore five aspects of the employment relationship - incentives, matching firms with workers, compensation, skill development, and the organization of work - reviewing the main theories, empirical tests of those theories, and the open questions in each area""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Social capital,Economic theory,"""This paper surveys research on social capital.  We explore the concepts that motivate the social capital literature, efforts to formally model social capital using economic theory, the econometrics of social capital, and empirical studies of the role of social capital in various socioeconomic outcomes.  While our focus is primarily on the place of social capital in economics, we do consider its broader social science context.  We argue that while the social capital literature has produced many insights, a number of conceptual and statistical problems exist with the current use of social capital by social scientists.  We propose some ways to strengthen the social capital literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Does market experience eliminate market anomalies? the case of exogenous market experience /,Economic theory,"""A vibrant literature has emerged that suggests willingness to pay and willingness to accept measures of value are quite different for inexperienced consumers but that value differences erode with market experience.

We discuss the optimal timing of investment over the life-cycle""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

The retirement of a consumption puzzle,Economic theory,"""This paper summarizes five facts that have emerged from the recent literature on consumption behavior during retirement.  Collectively, the recent literature has shown that there is no puzzle with respect to the spending patterns of most households as they transition into retirement.  In particular, the literature has shown that there is substantial heterogeneity in spending changes at retirement across consumption categories.  The declines in spending during retirement for the average household are limited to the categories of food and work related expenses.  Spending in nearly all other categories of non-durable expenditure remains constant or increases.  Moreover, even though food spending declines during retirement, actual food intake remains constant.  The literature also shows that there is substantial heterogeneity across households in the change in expenditure associated with retirement.  Much of this heterogeneity, however, can be explained by households involuntarily retiring due to deteriorating health.  Overall, the literature shows that the standard model of lifecycle consumption augmented with home production and uncertain health shocks does well in explaining the consumption patterns of most households as they transition into retirement""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

"Worker sorting, compensating differentials and health insurance evidence from displaced workers /",Economic theory,"""This article introduces an empirical strategy to the compensating differentials literature that i) allows both individual observed and unobserved characteristics to be rewarded differently in firms based on health insurance provision, and ii) selection to jobs that provide benefits to operate on both sides of the labor market.  Estimates of this model are used to directly test empirical assumptions that are made with popular econometric strategies in the health economics literature.  Our estimates reject the assumptions underlying numerous cross sectional and longitudinal estimators.  We find that the provision of health insurance has influenced wage inequality.  Finally, our results suggest there have been substantial changes in how displaced workers sort to firms that offer health insurance benefits over the past two decades.  We discuss the implications of our findings for the compensating differentials literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
What makes a die-hard entrepreneur? beyond the 'employee or entrepreneur' dichotomy,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The paper makes three contributions to the economics literature on entrepreneurship. We offer a new measure of entrepreneurship which accounts for variations in persistence in self-employment and as a result avoids the weakness of approaches which categorise an individual as an entrepreneur by observing their occupation at just one point in their career. We outline an econometric methodology to account for this approach and find that it is superior to probit/logit models which have dominated the literature. While our results indicate that this existing literature is good at explaining an individual's propensity to try self-employment, we find that entrepreneurial persistence is determined by a different model and unearth some new insights into the roles of early career experience, finance, role models, gender and the unemployment push effect""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
How to advance theory with structural vars use the sims-cogley-nason approach /,Economic theory,"""The common approach to evaluating a model in the structural VAR literature is to compare the impulse responses from structural VARs run on the data to the theoretical impulse responses from the model.  The Sims-Cogley-Nason approach instead compares the structural VARs run on the data to identical structural VARs run on data from the model of the same length as the actual data.  Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2006) argue that the inappropriate comparison made by the common approach is the root of the problems in the SVAR literature.  In practice, the problems can be solved simply.  Switching from the common approach to the Sims-Cogley-Nason approach basically involves changing a few lines of computer code and a few lines of text.  This switch will vastly increase the value of the structural VAR literature for economic theory""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Recent developments in intergenerational mobility,Economic theory,"""Economists and social scientists have long been interested in intergenerational mobility, and documenting the persistence between parents and children's outcomes has been an active area of research.  However, since Gary Solon's 1999 Chapter in the Handbook of Labor Economics, the literature has taken an interesting turn.  In addition to focusing on obtaining precise estimates of correlations and elasticities, the literature has placed increased emphasis on the causal mechanisms that underlie this relationship.  This chapter describes the developments in the intergenerational transmission literature since the 1999 Handbook Chapter.  While there have been some important contributions in terms of measurement of elasticities and correlations, we focus primarily on advances in our understanding of the forces driving the relationship and less on the precision of the correlations themselves""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Credit constraints as a barrier to technology adoption by the poor lessons from South Indian small-scale fishery /,Finance,"""It is generally recognized that the adoption of a new technology plays a fundamental role in the development process.  However, the benefits from the introduction of the technology may be unevenly distributed among the population, especially if the markets do not function properly.  While the microeconomic literature on technology adopted and diffusion focuses on ""who"" and ""when,"" the macroeconomic literature has focused on the overall impact of globalization on inequality.  In this paper the authors bring these two strands of the literature together by studying the diffusion of plastic reinforced fiber boats in a fishing village in Tamil Nadu and by analyzing the dynamics of income inequality during this process.

How well can the new open economy macroeconomics explain the exchange rate and current account?,Economic theory,"""This paper advances the new open economy macroeconomic (NOEM) literature in an empirical direction, estimating and testing a two-country model.  Fit to U.S and G-7 data, the model performs moderately well for the exchange rate and current account.  Results offer guidance for future theoretical work.  Parameter estimates lend support to some common assumptions in the theoretical literature, such as local currency pricing and risk sharing.  Estimates are found for key parameters commonly calibrated in the theoretical literature, such as the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign composite goods, and the response of a country risk premium to the net foreign asset position.  Results also indicate that deviations from interest rate parity are not closely related to monetary policy shocks, as recently hypothesized.  Further, results suggest that inserting explicit interest rate parity shocks into a NOEM model may be more helpful in explaining movements in the current account than the exchange rate""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Bargaining in legislatures an empirical investigation /,Economic theory,"""While the theoretical literature on non-cooperative legislative bargaining has grown voluminous, there is little empirical work attempting to test a key prediction in this literature: proposal power is valuable.  This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the role of proposal power in the allocation of transportation      projects across U.S.  Congressional districts in 1991 and 1998.  The evidence supports the key qualitative prediction of the Baron and Ferejohn legislative bargaining model: members with proposal power, those sitting on the transportation authorization committee, secure more project spending for their districts than do other representatives.  Support for the quantitative restrictions on the value of proposal power, which are more powerful than the qualitative restrictions, is more mixed.  I then empirically address several alternative models of legislative behavior, including partisian models, informational roles for committees, models with appropriations committees, and theories of committees as preference outliers""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
From brown to busing,Economic theory,"""An extensive literature debates the causes and consequences of the desegregation of American schools in the twentieth century.  Despite the social importance of desegregation and the magnitude of the literature, we have lacked a comprehensive accounting of the basic facts of school desegregation.  This paper uses newly assembled data to document when and how Southern school districts desegregated as well as the extent of court involvement in the desegregation process over the two full decades after Brown.  We also examine heterogeneity in the path to desegregation by district characteristics.  The results suggest that the existing quantitative literature, which generally either begins in 1968 and focuses on the role of federal courts in larger urban districts or relies on highly aggregated data, often tells an incomplete story of desegregation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

International coordination of fiscal policy in limiting economies,Economic theory,"""We examine the limiting behavior of cooperative and noncooperative fiscal policies as countries' market power goes to zero. We show that these policies converge if countries raise revenues through lump-sum taxation. However, if there are unremovable domestic distortions, such as distorting taxes, there can be gains to coordination even when a single country's policy cannot affect world prices. These results differ from the received wisdom in the optimal tariff literature. The key distinction is that, unlike in the tariff literature, the spending decisions of governments are explicitly modeled""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
Enforcement problems and secondary markets,Economic theory,"""There is a large and growing literature that studies the effects of weak enforcement institutions on economic performance.  This literature has focused almost exclusively on primary markets, in which assets are issued and traded to improve the allocation of investment and consumption.  The general conclusion is that weak enforcement institutions impair the workings of these markets, giving rise to various inefficiencies.  But weak enforcement institutions also create incentives to develop secondary markets, in which the assets issued in primary markets are retraded.  This paper shows that trading in secondary markets counteracts the effects of weak enforcement institutions and, in the absence of further frictions, restores efficiency""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Optimal income transfers,Economic theory,"""A substantial literature addresses the design of transfer programs and policies, including the negative income tax, other means-tested transfers, the earned income tax credit, categorical assistance, and work inducements.  This work is largely independent of that on the optimal nonlinear income tax, yet formulations of such a tax necessarily address how low-income individuals should be treated.  This paper draws on the optimal income taxation literature to illuminate the analysis of transfer programs, including the level and shape of marginal tax rates (including phase-outs), the structure of categorical assistance, and the role of work inducements in an optimal income transfer scheme""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Step-by-step migration to efficient agglomerations,Economic theory,"""Recent literature suggests that historical accidents can trap economies in inefficient equilibria. In a prototype model in the literature, there are two locations, the productive South and the unproductive North. By accident of history, the industry starts in the North.  Because of agglomeration economies, the industry may reside in the North forever---an inefficient outcome. This paper modifies the standard model by assuming there is a continuum of locations between the North and the South. Productivity gradually increases as one moves South. There is a unique long-run equilibrium in this economy where all agents locate at the most productive locations""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
The politics of monetary policy,Economic theory,"""In this paper we critically review the literature on the political economy of monetary policy, with an eye on the questions raised by the recent financial crisis.  We begin with a discussion of rules versus discretion.  We then examine the issue of Central Banks independence both in normal times and in times of crisis.  Then we review the literature of electoral manipulation of policies.  Finally we address international institutional issues concerning the feasibility, optimality and political sustainability of currency unions in which more than one country share the same currency.  A brief review of the Euro experience concludes the paper""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How outsourcing affects bilateral political relations,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""One issue the literature neglects is how outsourcing stimulates trade (imports, exports and foreign direct investment), thereby affecting political relations. However, at least as far back as 1750, economic philosophers such as Baron de Montesquieu in his L'Esprit des Lois, argued, ""peace is the natural effect of trade."" This paper first reviews this literature and then presents econometric evidence. The evidence integrates political international relations events data with economics data on bilateral trade. The resulting econometric models show that trade between nations fosters more peaceful dyadic relations""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
How do Canadian hours worked respond to a technology shock?,Finance,"""This paper investigates the response of hours worked to a permanent technology shock.  Based on annual data from Canada, we argue that hours worked rise after a positive technology shock.  We obtain a similar result using annual data from the United States.  These results contradict a large literature that claims that a positive technology shock causes hours worked to fall.  We find that the different results are due to the literature making a specification error in the statistical model of per capital hours worked.  Finally, we present results that Canadian monetary policy has accommodated technology shocks""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
What happens after a technology shock?,Finance,"""We provide empirical evidence that a positive shock to technology drives up per capita hours worked, consumption, investment, average productivity and output.  This evidence contrasts sharply with the results reported in a large and growing literature that argues, on the basis of aggregate data, that per capita hours worked fall after a positive technology shock.  We argue that the difference in results primarily reflects specification error in the way that the literature models the low-frequency component of hours worked""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Smooth nonexpected utility without state independence /,Economic theory,"""We propose a notion of smoothness of nonexpected utility  functions, which extends the variational analysis of nonexpected utility functions to more general settings. In particular, our theory applies to state dependent utilities, as well as the multiple prior expected utility model, both of which are not possible in previous literatures. Other nonexpected utility models are shown to satisfy smoothness under more general conditions than the Frʹechet and Gateaux differentiability used in the literature. We give more general characterizations of monotonicity and risk aversion without assuming state independence of utility function."""
Choosing the Joneses endogenous goals and reference standards /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A growing economic literature stresses the importance of relative comparisons, e.g., for savings and consumption or happiness. In this literature it is usually assumed that reference standards against which people compare themselves are exogenously given. In contrast findings from social psychology suggest that people play an active role in determining their reference standards. We present a social comparison model where people choose their reference standards to serve motives of self-improvement and self-enhancement. The model predicts that reference standards increase in individuals' abilities and that thus people tend to compare themselves to similar others. The results of a questionnaire study confirm the model's prediction""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

Procyclical fiscal policy in developing countries truth or fiction? /,Economic theory,"""A large empirical literature has found that fiscal policy in developing countries is procyclical, in contrast to high-income countries where it is countercyclical.  The idea that fiscal policy in developing countries is procyclical has all but reached the status of conventional wisdom.  This has sparked a growing theoretical literature that attempts to explain such a puzzle.  Some authors, however, have suggested that procyclical fiscal policy could be more fiction than truth since, by and large, the current literature has ignored endogeneity problems and may have simply misidentified a standard expansionary effect of fiscal policy.  To settle this issue of causality, we build a novel quarterly dataset for 49 countries covering the period 1960-2006, and subject the data to a battery of econometric tests: instrumental variables, simultaneous equations, and time-series methods.  We find overwhelming evidence to support the idea that procyclical fiscal policy in developing countries is in fact truth and not fiction.  We also find evidence that fiscal policy is expansionary -- a channel disregarded by the existing literature -- lending empirical support to the notion that when ""it rains, it pours.""""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Personnel economics hiring and incentives /,Economic theory,"""We survey the Personnel Economics literature, focusing on how firms establish, maintain, and end employment relationships and on how firms provide incentives to employees.  This literature has been very successful in generating models and empirical work about incentive systems.  Some of the unanswered questions in this area -- for example, the empirical relevance of the risk/incentive tradeoff and the question of whether CEO pay arrangements reflect competitive markets and efficient contracting -- are likely to be very difficult to answer due to measurement problems.  The literature has been less successful at explaining how firms can find the right employees in the first place.  Economists understand the broad economic forces -- matching with costly search and bilateral asymmetric information -- that firms face in trying to hire.  But the main models in this area treat firms as simple black-box production functions.  Less work has been done to understand how different firms approach the hiring problem, what determines the firm-level heterogeneity in hiring strategies, and whether these patterns conform to theory.  We survey some literature in this area and suggest areas for further research""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Nonlinearities and the macroeconomic effects of oil prices,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews some of the literature on the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks with a particular focus on possible nonlinearities in the relation and recent new results obtained by Kilian and Vigfusson (2009)""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trade and employment stylized facts and research findings /,Finance,"""The substantial literature investigating the links between trade, trade policy, and labor market outcomes-both returns to labor and employment-has generated a number of stylized facts, but many open questions remain.  This paper surveys the subset of the literature focusing on trade policy and integration into the world economy.  Although in the longer run trade opportunities can have a major impact in creating more productive and higher paying jobs, this literature tends to take employment as given.  A common finding is that much of the shorter run impacts of trade and reforms involve reallocation of labor or wage impacts within sectors.  This reflects a pattern of expansion of more productive firms-especially export-oriented or suppliers to exporters-and contraction and adjustment of less productive enterprises in sectors that become subject to greater import competition.  Wage responses to trade and trade reforms are generally greater than employment impacts, but trade can only explain a small fraction of the general increase in wage inequality observed in both industrial and developing countries in recent decades.  A feature of the literature survey is that the focus is almost exclusively on industries producing goods.  Given the importance of service industries as a source of employment and determinants of competitiveness, the paper argues that one priority area for future research is to study the employment effects of services trade and investment reforms. ""--World Bank web site."
Benefits and costs of international financial integration theory and facts /,Finance,"This literature review joins with recent studies in arguing that financial integration must be carefully prepared and managed to ensure that the benefits outweigh the short-run risks. But in contrast with some other studies, it adopts a more skeptical view of the benefits of capital flows other than foreign direct investment."
Is protection really for sale? a survey and directions for future research /,Economic theory,"""This paper critically and selectively surveys the literature on protection for sale and discusses directions for future research in this area.

Toward defining and measuring the affordability of public utility services,Finance,"""This paper reviews the progress made in the literature toward defining and measuring the affordability of utilities.  It highlights the relative merits of alternate affordability metrics; the practical challenges to their operationalization, including the underlying data requirements; and their implications for the design, evaluation, and implementation of appropriate affordability programs.

Resistant bodies in the cultural productions of transnational Hispanic Caribbean women : reimagining queer identity,Literature (general),"""Resistant Bodies in the Cultural Productions of Transnational Hispanic Caribbean Women: Reimagining Queer Identity examines the art created by several Caribbean women who use literature, film, graphic novels, music, testimonios, photographs, etc. to convey social justice, democracy, and new ways of re/imaging marginal identities. In using Chela Sandoval's theories on methodologies of the oppressed, Irune del Rio Gabiola argues how the tactics Sandoval offers can be productively applied to the cultural productions analyzed. The author explores how the protagonists of all the cultural productions this book focuses on developing tactics to create new possibilities and alternatives for self-fashioning. Particularly, del Rio Gabiola reconsiders concepts such as shame, failure, unbecoming, hermeneutics of love or flexible bodies as methodologies of the oppressed that propose decolonizing emancipatory techniques in a transnational arena."" -- Back cover."

Short sales and trade classification algorithms,Economic theory,"""This paper demonstrates that short sales are often misclassified as buyer-initiated by the Lee-Ready and other commonly used trade classification algorithms.  This result is due in part to regulations which require short sales be executed on an uptick or zero-uptick.  In addition, while the literature considers ""immediacy premiums"" in determining trade direction, it ignores the often larger borrowing premiums which short sellers must pay.  Since short sales constitute approximately 30% of all trade volume on U.S.  exchanges, these results are important to the empirical market microstructure literature as well as to measures that rely upon trade classification, such as the probability of informed trading (PIN) metric""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Central bank communication and monetary policy a survey of theory and evidence /,Economic theory,"""Over the last two decades, communication has become an increasingly important aspect of monetary policy.  These real-world developments have spawned a huge new scholarly literature on central bank communication -- mostly empirical, and almost all of it written in this decade.  We survey this ever-growing literature.  The evidence suggests that communication can be an important and powerful part of the central bank's toolkit since it has the ability to move financial markets, to enhance the predictability of monetary policy decisions, and potentially to help achieve central banks' macroeconomic objectives.  However, the large variation in communication strategies across central banks suggests that a consensus has yet to emerge on what constitutes an optimal communication strategy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Regression discontinuity designs a guide to practice /,Economic theory,"""In Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs for evaluating causal effects of interventions, assignment to a treatment is determined at least partly by the value of an observed covariate lying on either side of a fixed threshold.  These designs were first introduced in the evaluation literature by Thistlewaite and Campbell (1960).  With the exception of a few unpublished theoretical papers, these methods did not attract much attention in the economics literature until recently.  Starting in the late 1990s, there has been a large number of studies in economics applying and extending RD methods.  In this paper we review some of the practical and theoretical issues involved in the implementation of RD methods""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A skeptical appraisal of asset-pricing tests,Economic theory,"""It has become standard practice in the cross-sectional asset-pricing literature to evaluate models based on how well they explain average returns on size- and B/M-sorted portfolios, something many models seem to do remarkably well.  In this paper, we review and critique the empirical methods used in the literature.  We argue that asset-pricing tests are often highly misleading, in the sense that apparently strong explanatory power (high cross-sectional R2s and small pricing errors) in fact provides quite weak support for a model.  We offer a number of suggestions for improving empirical tests and evidence that several proposed models don't work as well as originally advertised""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
International happiness,Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  This paper describes the findings from a new, and intrinsically interdisciplinary, literature on happiness and human well-being.  The paper focuses on international evidence.  We report the patterns in modern data; we discuss what has been persuasively established and what has not; we suggest paths for future research.  Looking ahead, our instinct is that this social-science research avenue will gradually merge with a related literature -- from the medical, epidemiological, and biological sciences -- on biomarkers and health.  Nevertheless, we expect that intellectual convergence to happen slowly""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trade liberalization and firm dynamics,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we analyze the transition dynamics associated with an economy's response to trade liberalization.  We start by reviewing the recent literature that incorporates firm dynamics into models of international trade.  We then build upon that literature to characterize the role of firm dynamics, export-market selection, firm-level innovation, and firms' expectations regarding the time path of liberalization in generating those transition dynamics following trade liberalization.  These modeling ingredients generate substantial aggregate transition dynamics as they shift and shape the endogenous distribution of firms over time.  Our results show how the responses of trade volumes, innovation, and aggregate output can vary greatly over time depending on those modeling ingredients.  This has important consequences for many issues in international economics that rely on predictions for the effects of globalization over time on those key aggregate outcomes""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Educating urban children,Economic theory,"""For a variety of reasons described in the paper, improving the performance of urban school districts is more difficult today than it was several decades ago.  Yet economic and social changes make performance improvement especially important today.  Two quite different bodies of research provide ideas for improving the performance of urban school districts.  One group of studies, conducted primarily by scholars of organizational design, examines the effectiveness of particular district management strategies.  The second, conducted primarily by economists, focuses on the need to improve incentives.  Each body of research offers important insights.  Each is somewhat insensitive to the importance of the insights offered by the other literature.  A theme of this paper is that insights from both literatures are critical to improving urban school systems""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Economies of scale in the household puzzles and patterns from the American past /,Economic theory,"""Household economies of scale arise when households with multiple members share public goods, making larger households better off at lower per capita expenditures.  While estimates of household economies of scale are critical for measuring income and living standards, we do not know how these scale economies change over time.  I use American household expenditure surveys to produce the first comparable historical estimates of household scale economies.  I find that scale economies changed significantly from 1888 to 1935 for all expenditure categories considered (food, clothing, entertainment, and housing), but not all trends in scale economies are consistent with theoretical predictions.  I use these historical estimates of household scale economies to resolve several theoretical and empirical puzzles in the literature.  I find that existing explanations for puzzles in the household economies of scale literature do not hold in the past.  As such, our notions about household economies of scale must be reassessed in light of this historical evidence""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Enabling conditions for second pillars of pension systems,Finance,"""This note adds to the existing literature by examining the enabling conditions for the creation of mandatory funded pension funds, and identifying additional factors that are important to consider in the early stages of the reform.  The note stresses the importance of some factors that had already been identified in previous literature but not fully observed by reforming countries, including the strong and lasting commitment of the authorities with the reform, the fiscal commitment with the reform, and some basic financial infrastructure.  The analysis is also extended to analyze the role of supervision in the early stages of the reform and the role of the government in fostering the development of the domestic capital market. ""--World Bank web site."
Energy efficiency economics and policy,Economic theory,"""Energy efficiency and conservation are considered key means for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving other energy policy goals, but associated market behavior and policy responses have engendered debates in the economic literature.  We review economic concepts underlying consumer decision making in energy efficiency and conservation and examine related empirical literature.  In particular, we provide an economic perspective on the range of market barriers, market failures, and behavioral failures that have been cited in the energy efficiency context.  We assess the extent to which these conditions provide a motivation for policy intervention in energy-using product markets, including an examination of the evidence on policy effectiveness and cost.  Although theory and empirical evidence suggests there is potential for welfare-enhancing energy efficiency policies, many open questions remain, particularly relating to the extent of some key market and behavioral failures""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
An asset-pricing view of external adjustment,Economic theory,"""Recent evidence on the importance of cross-border equity flows calls for a rethinking of the standard theory of external adjustment.  We introduce equity holdings and portfolio choice into an otherwise conventional open-economy dynamic equilibrium model.  Our model is simple and admits a closed-form solution regardless of whether financial markets are complete or incomplete.  We find that the excessive emphasis put in the literature on solving models with incomplete markets for the sole purpose of obtaining nontrivial implications for the current account is misplaced.  We revisit the current debate on the relative importance of the standard vs.  the capital-gains-based (or ""valuation'') channels of the external adjustment and establish that in our framework they are congruent.  Our model's implications are consistent with a number of intriguing stylized facts documented in the recent empirical literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Who gets what from employer pay or play mandates?,Economic theory,"""Critics of pay or play mandates, borrowing from the large empirical minimum wage literature, provide evidence that they reduce employment.  Borrowing from a smaller empirical minimum wage literature, we provide evidence that they also are a blunt instrument for funding health insurance for the working poor.  The vast majority of those who benefit from pay or play mandates which require employers to either provide appropriate health insurance for their workers or pay a flat per hour tax to offset the cost of health care live in families with incomes twice the poverty line or more and, depending on how coverage is determined, the mandate will leave a significant share of the working poor ineligible for such benefits either because their hourly wage rate is too high or they work for smaller exempt firms""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Optimal control of externalities in the presence of income taxation,Economic theory,"""A substantial literature examines second-best environmental policy, focusing particularly on how the Pigouvian directive that marginal taxes should equal marginal external harms needs to be modified in light of the preexisting distortion due to labor income taxation.  Additional literature is motivated by the possibility that distributive concerns should amend the internalization prescription.  It is demonstrated, however that simple first, best rules, unmodified for labor supply distortion or distribution, are correct in a natural, basic formulation of the problem.  Specifically, setting all commodity taxes equal to marginal harms (and subsidies equal to marginal benefits) can generate a Pareto improvement.  Likewise, a marginal reform in the direction of the first-best can yield a Pareto improvement.  For other reforms, a simple efficiency test characterizing when a Pareto improvement is possible is offered.  Qualifications and explanations for the substantial departure from results in previous work are also elaborated""-National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Capital levies and transition to a consumption tax,Economic theory,"""The merits of capital levies depend on the likelihood of repetition, the extent of anticipation, and its effects on distribution.  The relevance of these features, which in varying degrees is underdeveloped or underappreciated in pertinent literatures, is elaborated and then considered with regard to the problem of transition to a consumption tax.  Other transition issues are distinguished, and specific attention is devoted to rate changes under a consumption tax and whether owners of preexisting capital are effectively compensated through higher net-of-tax returns due to repeal of the income tax.  The analysis is also related to literature that examines dynamic models of taxation, particularly work simulating consumption tax transitions and assessing the optimality of capital taxation in the long run""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Phillips curves and unemployment dynamics a critique and a holistic perspective /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The conventional wisdom that inflation and unemployment are unrelated in the long-run implies that these phenomena can be analysed by separate branches of economics. The macro literature tries to explain inflation dynamics and estimates the NAIRU. The labour macro literature tries to explain unemployment dynamics and determine the real economic factors that drive the natural rate of unemployment. We show that the orthodox view that the New Keynesian Phillips curve is vertical in the long-run and that it cannot generate substantial inflation persistence relies on the implausible assumption of a zero interest rate. In the light of these results, we argue that a holistic framework is needed to jointly explain the evolution of inflation and unemployment""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Imperfect competition and indeterminacy of aggregate output,Economic theory,"""This paper shows that imperfect competition can lead to indeterminacy in aggregate output in a standard DSGE model that features no distortions except imperfect competition.  Indeterminacy arises in the model from the composition of aggregate output.  In sharp contrast to the indeterminacy literature pioneered by Benhabib and Farmer (1994) and Gali (1994), indeterminacy in our model is global (i.e., independent of the eigenvalues near the steady state); hence it is robust to parameter values of the utility function and production technologies.  In addition, sunspots shocks to expectations in our model can be autocorrelated.  The paper provides a justification for exogenous variations over time in desired markups, which play an important role as a source of cost-push shocks in the monetary policy literature.  Our model can explain procyclical marginal cost and procyclical labor productivity simultaneously, and it outperforms a standard RBC model driven by technology shocks in explaining fluctuations in the labor market""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
The solution and estimation of discrete choice dynamic programming models by simulation and interpolation monte carlo evidence /,Economic theory,"""Over the past decade, a substantial literature on the estimation of discrete choice dynamic programming (DC-DP) models of behavior has developed. However, this literature now faces major computational barriers. Specifically, in order to solve the dynamic programming (DP) problems that generate agents' decision rules in DC-DP models, high dimensional integrations must be performed at each point in the state space of the DP problem. In this paper we explore the performance of approximate solutions to DP problems. Our approximation method consists of: 1) using Monte Carlo integration to simulate the required multiple integrals at a subset of the state points, and 2) interpolating the non-simulated values using a regression function. The overall performance of this approximation method appears to be excellent, both in terms of the degree to which it mimics the exact solution, and in terms of the parameter estimates it generates when embedded in an estimation algorithm""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
A recursive formulation for repeated agency with history dependence,Economic theory,"""There is now an extensive literature regarding the efficient design of incentive mechanisms in dynamic environments. In this literature, there are no exogenous links across time periods because either privately observed shocks are assumed time independent or past private actions have no influence on the realizations of current variables. The absence of exogenous links across time periods ensures that preferences over continuation contracts are common knowledge, making the definition of incentive compatible contracts at a point in time a simple matter. In this paper, we present general recursive methods to handle environments where privately observed variables are linked over time. We show that incentive compatible contracts are implemented recursively with a threat keeping constraint in addition to the usual temporary incentive compatibility conditions""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
"GDP, technical change, and the measurement of net income the Weitzman model revisited /",Economic theory,"""We show how technical change, measured as a shift in the GDP function, is combined with net income to track welfare change.  This provides a bridge between the productivity literature and the welfare-related literature that tends to reason in terms of net product functions: although the relevant income measure is net of depreciation, productivity is measured based on gross output.  We show that net product, net income, net expenditure and productivity change are complements, not substitutes.  We also examine whether holding gains and losses should be part of depreciation and conclude that in a general equilibrium setting, either productivity change or holding gains should be part of an extended Weitzman-type net income measure, but not both""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Work incentives and the food stamp program,Economic theory,"""Labor supply theory makes strong predictions about how the introduction of a social welfare program impacts work effort.  Although there is a large literature on the work incentive effects of AFDC and the EITC, relatively little is known about the work incentive effects of the Food Stamp Program and none of the existing literature is based on quasi-experimental methods.  We use the cross-county introduction of the program in the 1960s and 1970s to estimate the impact of the program on the extensive and intensive margins of labor supply, earnings, and family cash income.  Consistent with theory, we find modest reductions in employment and hours worked when food stamps are introduced.  The results are larger for single-parent families""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The economics of cultural transmission and socialization,Economic theory,"""Cultural transmission arguably plays an important role in the determination of many fundamental preference traits (e.g., discounting, risk aversion and altruism) and most cultural traits, social norms, and ideological tenets ( e.g., attitudes towards family and fertility practices, and attitudes in the job market).  It is, however, the pervasive evidence of the resilience of ethnic and religious traits across generations that motivates a large fraction of the theoretical and empirical literature on cultural transmission.  This article reviews the main contributions of models of cultural transmission, from theoretical and empirical perspectives.  It presents their implications regarding the long-run population dynamics of cultural traits and cultural heterogeneity, the world's geographical fragmentation by ethic and religious traits, at any given time.  Finally, the paper reviews the empirical literature which estimates various properties of cultural transmission mechanisms as well as the population dynamics of specific traits""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Limits of arbitrage the state of the theory /,Economic theory,"""We survey theoretical developments in the literature on the limits of arbitrage.  This literature investigates how costs faced by arbitrageurs can prevent them from eliminating mispricings and providing liquidity to other investors.  Research in this area is currently evolving into a broader agenda emphasizing the role of financial institutions and agency frictions for asset prices.  This research has the potential to explain so-called ""market anomalies"" and inform welfare and policy debates about asset markets.  We begin with examples of demand shocks that generate mispricings, arguing that they can stem from behavioral or from institutional considerations.  We next survey, and nest within a simple model, the following costs faced by arbitrageurs: (i) risk, both fundamental and non-fundamental, (ii) short-selling costs, (iii) leverage and margin constraints, and (iv) constraints on equity capital.  We finally discuss implications for welfare and policy, and suggest directions for future research""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Innovation and climate policy,Economic theory,"""Reducing emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change will require dramatic changes in the way that energy is produced and consumed.  The cost of technological changes such as alternative energy sources and improved energy efficiency will play a large role in determining the overall cost of combating climate change.  The development of these technologies will be heavily influenced by government policy.  Both environmental and R&D policies provide incentives encouraging the development of clean technologies.  Understanding the incentives provided by these policies, and their influence on the development of new technologies, is important for understanding the ultimate effects of climate policy.  This chapter reviews the literature on environmental innovation and diffusion, with a focus on studies relevant to the development of clean energy technologies necessary to address climate change.  I discuss the implications of this literature for the development of climate policy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Infrastructure concessions in Latin America government-led renegotiations /,Finance,"""The authors complement the existing knowledge in the renegotiation literature on infrastructure concessions by analyzing government-led renegotiations.  They first propose a multiple-period theoretical framework in which both Pareto-improving and rent-shifting renegotiations at the initiative of the government can occur.  They then perform an empirical analysis based on a sample of 307 water and transport projects in five Latin American countries between 1989 and 2000.  While some of the main insights from the previous literature are unchanged, for example concerning the importance of having a regulator in place when awarding concessions and the fragility of price cap regulatory schemes, there are also significant differences as predicted by the model, in particular with respect to the effect of investment and financing, as well as the corruption variables.  The authors provide additional evidence showing that a good regulatory framework is especially important in contexts with weak governance and political opportunism. ""--World Bank web site."
"New Keynesian, open-economy models and their implications for monetary policy",Finance,"""The considerable amount of research in recent years on New Keynesian, open-economy models--models with nominal price rigidities and intertemporally maximizing agents--has yielded fresh insights for what Alan Blinder has called the ""dark art"" of making monetary policy.  The literature has made its greatest contributions in understanding the transmission of shocks across countries, exchange rate pass-through and the effects of different pricing rules, and how these impact optimal monetary policy rules and international policy coordination.  While the literature has by no means solved the great mysteries of open-economy macroeconomics, it has laid out a framework where we can ask normative questions of monetary policy, such as how much a central bank should react to movements in the exchange rate.  However, monetary policy remains an empirical endeavour, and would be helped by further work which empirically estimates or calibrates these new models""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Privatization's impact on private productivity the case of Brazilian iron ore /,Economic theory,"""A major motivation for the wave of privatizations of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the last twenty years was a belief that privatization would increase economic efficiency.  There are now many studies showing most privatizations achieved this goal.  Our theme is that the productivity gains from privatization are much more general and widespread than has typically been recognized in this literature.  In assessing the productivity gains from privatization, the literature has only examined the productivity gains accruing at the privatized SOEs.  But privatization may have significant impact on the private producers that often exist side-by-side with SOEs.  In this paper we show that this was indeed the case when Brazil privatized its SOEs in the iron ore industry.  That is, after their privatization, the iron ore SOEs dramatically increased their labor productivity, but so did the private iron ore companies in the industry""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
"Growth, inequality and poverty relationships","Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper examines the causal relationship between inequality and a number of macroeconomic variables frequently found in the inequality and growth literature. These include growth, openness, wages, and liberalisation. We review the existing cross-country empirical evidence on the effects of inequality on growth and the extent to which the poorest in society benefit from economic growth. The linkage between growth, redistribution and poverty is also analysed. In the review of literature mainly empirical examples from 1990s are taken. In addition we test the conditional and unconditional relationship between inequality and growth in the post World War II period using WIDER inequality database. Regression results suggest that income inequality is declining over time. Inequality is also declining in growth of income. There is a significant regional heterogeneity in the levels and development over time. The Kuznets hypothesis represents a global U-shape relationship between inequality and growth""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Measuring organizational capital in the new economy,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A growing body of literature over the past decade suggests that a firm's organizational structure/capital can contribute in significant ways to the productive capacity of a firm. But, as with other intangible assets, there is no consensus definition of what this organizational capital is, how to measure it, or how to best quantify its contribution to output (either current or future). We try to address this gap in the literature by proposing a definition of organizational capital based on recent empirical work on the impact of organizational capital on firm productivity and workers' wages. We then discuss in detail how organizational capital has been measured and the measurement issues that face those trying to understand the extent of organizational capital in an economy""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"The effects of the minimum wage on wages, employment and prices","Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper puts together evidence for the wages, employment and price effects of the minimum wage. This overall picture will help to understand the small employment effects prevalent in the literature in the light of price effects. The data used is an under-explored monthly Brazilian household survey from 1982 to 2000, similar to the US CPS. As the international literature on the minimum wage is scanty on non-US empirical evidence, in particular on developing countries, this paper will also help to extend the current understanding on the effects of the minimum wage in developing countries. This is crucial if the minimum wage is to be used as a policy to help poor people in poor countries""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Political variables as instruments for the minimum wage,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Following the early 1980s apparent consensus, there has been a controversial debate in the literature over the direction of the minimum wage employment effect. Explanations to nonnegative effects range from theoretical to empirical identification and data issues. An explanation, however, that has not been sufficiently explored is that a non-negative effect might be an upward biased estimate of a truly negative effect, resulting from the simultaneous determination of the minimum wage and employment. This paper estimates the employment effect of the minimum wage using a number of political variables -- not previously used in the literature -- as excluded exogenous instruments to control for the endogeneity of the minimum wage variable.

A critique of structural VARS using business cycle theory,Economic theory,"""The main substantive finding of the recent structural vector autoregression literature with a differenced specification of hours (DSVAR) is that technology shocks lead to a fall in hours. Researchers have used these results to argue that business cycle models in which technology shocks lead to a rise in hours should be discarded. We evaluate the DSVAR approach by asking, is the specification derived from this approach misspecified when the data are generated by the very model the literature is trying to discard? We find that it is misspecified. Moreover, this misspecification is so great that it leads to mistaken inferences that are quantitatively large. We show that the other popular specification that uses the level of hours (LSVAR) is also misspecified.We argue that alternative state space approaches, including the business cycle accounting approach, are more fruitful techniques for guiding the development of business cycle theory""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
Hospital ownership and financial performance a quantitative research review /,Economic theory,"""We apply meta-analytic methods to conduct a quantitative review of the empirical literature since 1990 comparing financial performance of US for-profit, not-for-profit, and government-owned general acute hospitals.  We find that the diverse results in the hospital ownership literature can be explained largely by differences in authors' underlying theoretical frameworks, assumptions about the functional form of the dependent variables, and model specifications.  Weaker methods and functional forms tend to predict larger differences in financial performance between not-for-profits and for-profits.  The combined estimates across studies suggest little difference in cost among all three types of hospital ownership, and that for-profit hospitals generate more revenue and greater profits than not-for-profit hospitals, although the difference is only of modest economic significance.  There is little difference in revenue or profits between government and not-for-profit hospitals""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Tiebout sorting, social multipliers, and the demand for school quality",Economic theory,"""In many theoretical public finance models, school quality plays a central role as a determinant of household location choices and in turn, of neighborhood stratification.  In contrast, the recent empirical literature has almost universally concluded that the direct effect of school quality on housing demand is weak, a conclusion that is robust across a variety of research designs.  Using an equilibrium model of residential sorting, this paper closes the gap between these literatures, providing clear evidence that the full effect of school quality on residential sorting is significantly larger than the direct effect %uF818 four times as great for education stratification, twice for income stratification.  This is due to a strong social multiplier associated with heterogeneous preferences for peers and neighbors; initial changes in school quality set in motion a process of re-sorting on the basis of neighborhood characteristics that reinforces itself, giving rise to substantially larger stratification effects""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Can Markov switching models predict excess foreign exchange returns?,Economic theory,"""This paper merges the literature on high-frequency technical trading rules with the literature on Markov switching at low frequencies to develop economically useful trading rules.  The Markov switching models produce out-of-sample excess returns that exceed those of standard technical trading rules and are fairly stable over time.  The model's intrinsic density forecast enables a value-at-risk adjustment to minimize the periods of poor performance.  The Markov rules' high excess returns contrast with their mixed performance on statistical tests of forecast accuracy.  The investigation fails to identify a clear macroeconomic source for the apparently exploitable trends, although it does highlight the importance of conditioning trading rules on higher moments of the exchange rate distribution""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Estimating standard errors in finance panel data sets comparing approaches /,Economic theory,"""In both corporate finance and asset pricing empirical work, researchers are often confronted with panel data.  In these data sets, the residuals may be correlated across firms and across time, and OLS standard errors can be biased.  Historically, the two literatures have used different solutions to this problem.  Corporate finance has relied on Rogers standard errors, while asset pricing has used the Fama-MacBeth procedure to estimate standard errors.  This paper will examine the different methods used in the literature and explain when the different methods yield the same (and correct) standard errors and when they diverge.  The intent is to provide intuition as to why the different approaches sometimes give different answers and give researchers guidance for their use""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Income tax design and the desirability of subsidies to secondary workers in a household model with joint and non-joint time,Economic theory,"""In this paper we analyze income tax design in a two member household labor supply model where time spent on consumption together by the two household members is valued differently from time spent apart.  We treat consumption as a non excludable public good to members of the household; one example would be where all household members or one alone can watch TV.  When jointly consumed, however, TV services are valued more highly than the same consumption undertaken separately.  We use this model to numerically investigate the welfare implications of different tax structures.  In sharp contrast to existing literature, our results suggest the desirability of subsidizing secondary worker's labor supply.  We also relate our discussion to existing individual-household tax unit literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The return to schooling in structural dynamic models a survey /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper contains a survey of the recent literature devoted to the returns to schooling within a dynamic structural framework. I present a historical perspective on the evolution of the literature, from early static models set in a selectivity framework (Willis and Rosen, 1979) to the recent literature, stimulated by Keane and Wolpin (1997), and which uses stochastic dynamic programming techniques. After reviewing the literature thoroughly, I compare the structural approach with the IV (experimental) approach. I present their commonalities and I also discuss their fundamental differences. To get an order of magnitude, most structural estimates reported for the US range between 4% and 7% per year. On the other hand, IV estimates between 10% and 15% per year are often reported. The discrepancy prevails even when comparable (if not identical) data sets are used. The discussion is focused on understanding this divergence. The distinction between static and dynamic model specifications is a recurrent theme in the analysis. I argue that the distinction between the IV approach and the structural approach may be coined in terms of a trade off between behavioral and statistical assumptions. For this reason, and unless one has very specific knowledge of the true data generating process, it is neither possible, nor sensible, to claim which approach to estimation is more flexible. More precisely, I show that structural and IV approaches differ mainly at the level of i) the compatibility of the underlying models with truly dynamic behavior, ii) the role of heterogeneity in ability and tastes, iii) the consideration of post-schooling opportunities, and (iv) the specification (and interpretation) of the Mincer wage equation""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

What determines protection of property rights ? an analysis of direct and indirect effects,Finance,"""Using cross-country data, the authors evaluate historical determinants of protection of property rights.  They examine four historical theories that focus on conceptually distinct causal variables believed to shape institutions: legal origin, endowments, ethnic diversity, and religion.  There is only one realization of the data with relatively few observations, which have by now been well explored in the literature.  Given the correlations between the explanatory variables, it is difficult to fashion empirical tests which are consistent in their treatment of the competing theories and to know which regressions to take seriously, giving rise to competing interpretations in the literature.  The authors use Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) methodology to identify which historical factors are direct determinants of property rights protection and which are not, and subject the outcomes to a battery of robustness tests.  The empirical results support ethnic fractionalization as a robust determinant of property rights protection.  Despite the attention it has received in the literature, the impact of legal origin on protection of property rights appears fragile and dependent on the inclusion of transition economies in the sample.

What do we know about competition and quality in health care markets?,Economic theory,"""The goal of this paper is to identify key issues concerning the nature of competition in health care markets and its impacts on quality and social welfare and to identify pertinent findings from the theoretical and empirical literature on this topic.  The theoretical literature in economics on competition and quality, the theoretical literature in health economics on this topic, and the empirical findings on competition and quality in health care markets are surveyed and their findings assessed.Theory is clear that competition increases quality and improves consumer welfare when prices are regulated (for prices above marginal cost), although the impacts on social welfare are ambiguous.  When firms set both price and quality, both the positive and normative impacts of competition are ambiguous.  The body of empirical work in this area is growing rapidly.  At present it consists entirely of work on hospital markets.  The bulk of the empirical evidence for Medicare patients shows that quality is higher in more competitive markets.  The empirical results for privately insured patients are mixed across studies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The economics of conflicts of interest in financial institutions,Economic theory,"""A conflict of interest exists when a party to a transaction could potentially make a gain from taking actions that are detrimental to the other party in the transaction.  This paper examines the economics of conflicts of interest in financial institutions and reviews the growing empirical literature (mostly focused on analysts) on the economic implications of these conflicts.  Economic analysis shows that, although conflicts of interest are omnipresent when contracting is costly and parties are imperfectly informed, there are important factors that mitigate their impact and, strikingly, it is possible for customers of financial institutions to benefit from the existence of such conflicts.  The empirical literature reaches conclusions that differ across types of conflicts of interest, but overall these conclusions are more ambivalent and certainly more benign than the conclusions drawn by journalists and politicians from mostly anecdotal evidence.  Though much has been made of conflicts of interest arising from investment banking activities, there is no consensus in the empirical literature supporting the view that conflicts resulting from these activities had a systematic adverse impact on customers of financial institutions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Home production and the macro economy-some lessons from pollak and wachter and from transition russia,Economic theory,"""Recent years witnessed a flourishing of literature on the implication of shifts from home- production to market production on the macro economy, and in particular, the real business cycle.  This literature employs calibration techniques to emulate the fluctuations in market output, labor and capital inputs and productivity over the business cycle, assuming a representative consumer and using stylized parameters of the substitution elasticity between home and market goods, and of the home production function.  This paper argues that the parameters used in this literature cannot be verified empirically because of econometric identification problems.  Furthermore, using data from the late 90s from transition Russia, it is argued that one cannot capture the fluctuation between the home and the market by using a representative consumer, since there is a distinct difference between males and females in their reaction to loss of employment: men shift most of the time released from market work to leisure while women divide it almost equally between work at home and leisure.  Finally it is shown that the switch from a controlled economy to a market economy resulted in significant increase in home productivity and an increase in the free time enjoyed by both Russian men and women""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How do banks set interest rates?,Economic theory,"""The aim of this paper is to study cross-sectional differences in banks interest rates.  It adds to the existing literature in two ways.  First, it analyzes in a systematic way both micro and macroeconomic factors that influence the price setting behavior of banks.  Second, by using banks' prices (rather than quantities) it provides an alternative way to disentangle loan supply from loan demand shift in the bank lending channel' literature.  The results, derived from a sample of Italian banks, suggest that heterogeneity in the banking rates pass-through exists only in the short run.  Consistently with the literature for Italy, interest rates on shortterm lending of liquid and well-capitalized banks react less to a monetary policy shock.  Also banks with a high proportion of long-term lending tend to change their prices less.  Heterogeneity in the pass-through on the interest rate on current accounts depends mainly on banks' liability structure.  Bank's size is never relevant""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Varieties of currency crises,Economic theory,"""The plethora of currency crises around the world has fueled many theories on the causes of speculative attacks.  The first-generation models focus on fiscal problems.  The second-generation models emphasize countercyclical policies and self-fulfilling crises.  In the 1990s, models pinpoint to financial excesses.  With the crisis of Argentina in 2001, models of sovereign default have become popular again.  While the theoretical literature has emphasized variety, the empirical literature has supported the one size fits all' models.  This paper contributes to the empirical literature by assessing whether the crises of the last thirty years are of different varieties.  Crises are found to be of six varieties.  Four of those varieties are associated with domestic economic fragility.  But crises can also be provoked by just adverse world market conditions, such as the reversal of international capital flows.  The so-called sudden-stop phenomenon identifies the fifth variety of crises.  Finally, a small number of crises occur in economies with immaculate fundamentals but this type of crises is not an emerging-market phenomenon""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Evaluation of exchange-rate, capital market, and dollarization regimes in the presence of sudden stops",Economic theory,"""The literature has not being able to identify clear-cut real effects of exchange-rate regimes on output growth.  Similarly, no definitive view emerges from the literature in regard to the effects of open capital markets on macroeconomic performance.  The paper attributes the failure of the literature to fundamental flaws, consisting of ignoring non-linearities in the effects of exchange rate and capital-market liberalization regimes, on the macroeconomic performance.  The paper develops a methodology consisting of accounting for the ""crisis-prone state of the economy"", summarized by a projected probability of crisis, due to sudden stops in international capital inflows.  We apply the new methodology to a cross-country panel of 100 low and middle-income countries.  Findings indicate that the effects of exchange rate regimes, and liberalization regimes, on macroeconomic performance go through two distinct channels: a direct channel via the real side of the economy, and an indirect channel via the financial side, which influences the probability of sudden stops.  We also analyze how the projected probability of sudden stops affects the level of dollarization, and provide estimates for the effect of dollarization on growth""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The responsiveness of consumer prices to exchange rates and the implications for exchange-rate policy a survey of a few recent new open-economy macro models /,Economic theory,"""The traditional case for flexibility in nominal exchange rates assumes that there is nominal price stickiness that prevents relative prices from adjusting in response to real shocks.  When prices are sticky in producers' currencies, nominal exchange rate changes can achieve the relative price change that is required between home and foreign goods.  The nominal exchange rate flexibility provides the desired 'expenditure-switching' effect of relative price changes.  But if prices are fixed ex ante in consumers' currencies, nominal exchange rate flexibility cannot achieve any relative price adjustment.  In fact, nominal exchange rate fluctuations are undesirable because they lead to deviations from the law of one price.  So, fixed exchange rates are optimal.  The empirical literature appears to support the notion that prices are sticky in consumers' currencies.  This paper surveys the approaches taken in the new open economy macroeconomic literature to formalize the role of optimal monetary policy.  The survey explores how this literature has dealt with the empirical evidence on pass-through of exchange rate changes to consumer prices""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The economics of migrants' remittances,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This chapter reviews the recent theoretical and empirical economic literature on migrants' remittances. It is divided between a microeconomic section on the determinants of remittances and a macroeconomic section on their growth effects. At the micro level we first present in a fully harmonized framework the various motivations to remit described so far in the literature. We show that models based on different motives share many common predictions, making it difficult to implement truly discriminative tests in the absence of sufficiently detailed data on migrants and receiving households' characteristics and on the timing of remittances. The results from selected empirical studies show that a mixture of individualistic and familial motives explains the likelihood and size of remittances. At the macro level we first briefly review the standard (Keynesian) and the trade-theoretic literature on the short-run impact of remittances. We then use an endogenous growth framework to describe the growth potential of remittances and present the evidence for different growth channels. We then explore the relationship between remittances and inequality. This relationship appears to be non-monotonic. This is consistent with different theoretical arguments regarding the role of migration networks and/or the dynamics of wealth transmission between successive generations""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Trade, inequality, and the political economy of institutions",Finance,"""The authors analyze the relationship between international trade and the quality of economic institutions such as contract enforcement, rule of law, or property rights.  The literature on institutions has argued, both empirically and theoretically, that larger firms care less about good institutions and that higher inequality leads to worse institutions.  Recent literature on international trade enables the authors to analyze economies with heterogeneous firms, and argue that trade opening leads to a reallocation of production in which large firms grow larger, while small firms become smaller or disappear.  Combining these two strands of literature, the authors build a model that has two key features.  First, preferences over institutional quality differ across firms and depend on firm size.  Second, institutional quality is endogenously determined in a political economy framework.  They show that trade opening can worsen institutions when it increases the political power of a small elite of large exporters that prefer to maintain bad institutions.  The detrimental effect of trade on institutions is most likely to occur when a small country captures a sufficiently large share of world exports in sectors characterized by economic profits.

Evaluating recipes for development success,Finance,"""This paper provides a review of the contradictions and conflicts in the literature on economic governance and sketches an approach to use some of the conceptual and empirical findings from that literature for development policy.  The literature offers conflicting conclusions on big questions: whether history and geography preordain a country's economic fate, whether democracy or authoritarianism promotes growth; whether informal or formal mechanisms are best; whether ""big bang"" or gradual transitions promote growth; and whether disasters and demographics are stumbling blocks or stepping stones.  The author finds recipes for success that are infeasible, contradictory and shifting, and that ignore the role of luck in development policy.  While the researcher may ask, ""What creates success on average across countries?"" the policymaker needs to know, ""What is going wrong in this country and how can we put it right?"" The author suggests a preliminary approach to combine the practitioner's detailed knowledge of country conditions with the broader patterns uncovered by scholars, building on ""growth diagnostics"" that identify binding constraints to development.  But he shifts from the sequential ""decision tree"" framework to a more directly ""diagnostic"" approach that recognizes that policymakers must deal with many factors simultaneously.  The framework he suggests combines empirical information on potential causes, estimates of their probabilities, and observed effects.  He proposes this framework as the foundation, not for another recipe, but for a broader mode of thought to tackle the complexity and variance in development processes and patterns across countries and time-one country at a time.

Body composition and wages,Economic theory,"""This paper examines the effect of body composition on wages.  We develop measures of body composition ́"" body fat (BF) and fat-free mass (FFM)"" using data on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) that are available in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III and estimate wage models for respondents in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979.  Our results indicate that increased body fat is unambiguously associated with decreased wages for both males and females.  This result is in contrast to the mixed and sometimes inconsistent results from the previous research using body mass index (BMI).  We also find new evidence indicating that a higher level of fat-free body mass is consistently associated with increased hourly wages.  We present further evidence that these results are not the artifacts of unobserved heterogeneity.  Our findings are robust to numerous specification checks and to a large number of alternative BIA prediction equations from which the body composition measures are derived.Our work addresses an important limitation of the current literature on the economics of obesity.  Previous research relied on body weight or BMI for measuring obesity despite the growing agreement in the medical literature that they represent misleading measures of obesity because of their inability to distinguish between body fat and fat-free body mass.  Body composition measures used in this paper represent significant improvements over the previously used measures because they allow for the effects of fat and fat free components of body composition to be separately identified.  Our work also contributes to the growing literature on the role of non-cognitive characteristics on wage determination""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Does child abuse cause crime?,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Child maltreatment, which includes both child abuse and child neglect, is a major social problem. This paper focuses on measuring the effects of child maltreatment on crime using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We focus on crime because it is one of the most socially costly potential outcomes of maltreatment, and because the proposed mechanisms linking maltreatment and crime are relatively well elucidated in the literature. Our work addresses many limitations of the existing literature on child maltreatment. First, we use a large national sample, and investigate different types of abuse in a similar framework. Second, we pay careful attention to identifying the causal impact of abuse, by using a variety of statistical methods that make differing assumptions. These methods include: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), propensity score matching estimators, and twin fixed effects. Finally, we examine the extent to which the effects of maltreatment vary with socio-economic status (SES), gender, and the severity of the maltreatment. We find that maltreatment approximately doubles the probability of engaging in many types of crime. Low SES children are both more likely to be mistreated and suffer more damaging effects. Boys are at greater risk than girls, at least in terms of increased propensity to commit crime. Sexual abuse appears to have the largest negative effects, perhaps justifying the emphasis on this type of abuse in the literature. Finally, the probability of engaging in crime increases with the experience of multiple forms of maltreatment as well as the experience of Child Protective Services (CPS) investigation""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Financial development, financial fragility, and growth",Finance,"""Loayza and Rancir̀e study the apparent contradiction between two strands of the literature on the effects of financial intermediation on economic activity.  On the one hand, the empirical growth literature finds a positive effect of financial depth as measured by, for instance, private domestic credit and liquid liabilities (for example, Levine, Loayza, and Beck 2000).  On the other hand, the banking and currency crisis literature finds that monetary aggregates, such as domestic credit, are among the best predictors of crises and their related economic downturns (for example, Kaminski and Reinhart 1999).  The authors account for these contrasting effects based on the distinction between the short- and long-run impacts of financial intermediation.  Working with a panel of cross-country and time-series observations, they estimate an encompassing model of short- and long-run effects using the Pooled Mean Group estimator developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999).  Their conclusion from this analysis is that a positive long-run relationship between financial intermediation and output growth coexists with a mostly negative short-run relationship.  The authors further develop an explanation for these contrasting effects by relating them to recent theoretical models, by linking the estimated short-run effects to measures of financial fragility (namely, banking crises and financial volatility), and by jointly analyzing the effects of financial depth and fragility in classic panel growth regressions.  This paper--a product of the Growth and Investment Team, Development Research Group--is part of a larger effort in the group to understand the sources of growth and volatility""--World Bank web site."

Distributional impacts of the self-sufficiency project,Economic theory,"""A large literature has been concerned with the impacts of recent welfare reforms on income, earnings, transfers, and labor-force attachment.  While one strand of this literature relies on observational studies conducted with large survey-sample data sets, a second makes use of data generated by experimental evaluations of changes to means-tested programs.  Much of the overall literature has focused on mean impacts.  In this paper, we use random-assignment experimental data from Canada's Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) to look at impacts of this unique reform on the distributions of income, earnings, and transfers.  SSP offered members of the treatment group a generous subsidy for working full time.  Quantile treatment effect (QTE) estimates show there was considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of SSP on the distributions of earnings, transfers, and total income; heterogeneity that would be missed by looking only at average treatment effects.  Moreover, these heterogeneous impacts are consistent with the predictions of labor supply theory.  During the period when the subsidy is available, the SSP impact on the earnings distribution is zero for the bottom half of the distribution.  The SSP earnings distribution is higher for much of the upper third of the distribution except at the very top, where the earnings distribution is the same under either program or possibly lower under SSP.  Further, during the period when SSP receipt was possible, the impacts on the distributions of transfer payments (IA plus the subsidy) and total income (earnings plus transfers) are also different at different points of the distribution.  In particular, positive impacts on the transfer distribution are concentrated at the lower end of the transfer distribution while positive impacts on the income distribution are concentrated in the upper end of the income distribution.  Impacts of SSP on these distributions were essentially zero after the subsidy was no longer available""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Earnings functions, rates of return and treatment effects the Mincer equation and beyond /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""Numerous studies regress log earnings on schooling and report estimated coefficients as ""Mincer rates of return"". A more recent literature uses instrumental variables. This chapter considers the economic interpretation of these analyses and how the availability of repeated cross section and panel data improves the ability of analysts to estimate the rate of return. We consider under what conditions the Mincer model estimates an ex post rate of return. We test and reject the model on six cross sections of U.S. Census data. We present a general nonparametric approach for estimating marginal internal rates of return that takes into account tuition, income taxes and forms of uncertainty. We also contrast estimates based on a single cross-section of data, using the synthetic cohort approach, with estimates based on repeated cross-sections following actual cohorts. Cohort-based models fitted on repeated cross section data provide more reliable estimates of ex post returns. Accounting for uncertainty affects estimates of rates of return. Accounting for sequential revelation of information calls into question the validity of the internal rate of return as a tool for policy analysis. An alternative approach to computing economic rates of return that accounts for sequential revelation of information is proposed and the evidence is summarized. We distinguish ex ante from ex post returns. New panel data methods for estimating the uncertainty and psychic costs facing agents are reviewed. We report recent evidence that demonstrates that there are large psychic costs of schooling. This helps to explain why persons do not attend school even though the financial rewards for doing so are high. We present methods for computing distributions of returns ex ante and ex post. We review the literature on IV estimation. The link of the estimates to the economics is not strong. The traditional instruments are weak, and this literature has not produced decisive empirical estimates. We exposit new methods that interpret the economic content of different instruments within a unified framework""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

On the network topology of variance decompositions measuring the connectedness of financial firms /,Economic theory,"""We propose several connectedness measures built from pieces of variance decompositions, and we argue that they provide natural and insightful measures of connectedness among financial asset returns and volatilities.  We also show that variance decompositions define weighted, directed networks, so that our connectedness measures are intimately-related to key measures of connectedness used in the network literature.  Building on these insights, we track both average and daily time-varying connectedness of major U.S.  financial institutions' stock return volatilities in recent years, including during the financial crisis of 2007-2008""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A note on schooling in development accounting,Economic theory,"""How much would output increase if underdeveloped economies were to increase their levels of schooling? We contribute to the development accounting literature by describing a non-parametric upper bound on the increase in output that can be generated by more schooling.  The advantage of our approach is that the upper bound is valid for any number of schooling levels with arbitrary patterns of substitution/complementarity.  We also quantify the upper bound for all economies with the necessary data, compare our results with the standard development accounting approach, and provide an update on the results using the standard approach for a large sample of countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Is the obesity epidemic a public health problem? a decade of research on the economics of obesity /,Economic theory,"""The world-wide and ongoing rise in obesity has generated enormous popular interest and policy concern in developing countries, where it is rapidly becoming the major public health problem facing such nations.  As a consequence, there has been a rapidly growing field of economic analysis of the causes and consequences of this phenomenon.  This paper discusses some of the central themes of this decade long research program, aiming at synthesizing the different strands of the literature, and to point to future research that seems particularly productive""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Biological innovation and productivity growth in the antebellum cotton economy,Economic theory,"""The Cliometrics literature on slave efficiency has generally focused on static questions.  We take a decidedly more dynamic approach.  Drawing on the records of 142 plantations with 509 crops years, we show that the average daily cotton picking rate increased about four-fold between 1801 and 1862.  We argue that the development and diffusion of new cotton varieties were the primary sources of the increased efficiency.  These finding have broad implications for understanding the South's preeminence in the world cotton market, the pace of westward expansion, and the importance of indigenous technological innovation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A quantile-based test of protection for sale model,Economic theory,"""This paper proposes a new test of the Protection for Sale (PFS) model by Grossman and Helpman (1994).  Unlike existing methods in the literature, our approach does not require any data on political organizations.  We formally show that the PFS model predicts that the quantile regression of the protection measure on the inverse import penetration ratio divided by the import demand elasticity, should yield a positive coefficient for quantiles close to one.  We test this prediction using the data from Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000).  The results do not provide any evidence favoring the PFS model""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Is there dowry inflation in South Asia?,Economic theory,"""This paper is the first systematic attempt to measure the existence and degree of dowry inflation in South Asia.  The popular press and scholarly literature have assumed dowry inflation in South Asia for some time, and there are now a number of theoretical papers that have attempted to explain the rise of dowries in South Asia.  Despite these advances, there has been no systematic study of dowry inflation.  Using large-sample retrospective survey data from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal, we assess the empirical evidence for dowry infllation.  We find no evidence that real dowry amounts have systematically increased over time in South Asia""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
May growth lead to higher deprivation despite higher satisfaction?,Finance,"""In a relative deprivation framework, unless inequality is reduced, growth is associated with both higher satisfaction and higher deprivation.  This may help explain the discontent with growth despite its benefits.  As is well known in the literature, knowledge of the population's mean income and Lorenz curve is all that is needed to analyze a distribution, so that this can also be used to assess the satisfaction and deprivation of each individual.  Given the normalization used to derive the satisfaction and deprivation measures, satisfaction and deprivation add up to the mean income for the population as a whole as well as for each individual.

Natural disasters and human capital accumulation,Finance,"""The author assesses empirically the relationship between natural disaster risk and investment in education.  Although the results in the empirical literature tend to be inconclusive, using model averaging methods in the framework of cross-country and panel regressions, this paper finds an extremely robust negative partial correlation between secondary school enrollment and natural disaster risk.  This result is exclusively driven by geological disasters.  Natural disaster risk exposure is a robust determinant of differences in secondary school enrollment between countries, but not within countries, which implies that the effect can be interpreted as a long-run phenomenon. ""--World Bank web site."
Momentum cycles and limits to arbitrage evidence from Victorian England and post-depression US stock markets,Economic theory,"""We evaluate the importance of ""Limits to Arbitrage"" to explain profitability of momentum strategies.  Specifically, when the availability of arbitrage capital is in short supply, momentum cycles last longer, and breaks in momentum cycles are shorter.  We demonstrate the robustness of our findings with a unique database of stock returns from1866-1907 London and the CRSP database.  Momentum cycle durations are similar in both databases and all other momentum facts documented in the literature using the CRSP database hold for the Victorian period as well, except for the January reversal due to the absence of capital gains taxation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Measuring the returns to R&D,Economic theory,"""We review the econometric literature on measuring the returns to R&D.  The theoretical frameworks that have been used are outlined, followed by an extensive discussion of measurement and econometric issues that arise when estimating the models.  We then provide a series of tables summarizing the major results that have been obtained and conclude with a presentation of R&D spillover returns measurement.  In general, the private returns to R&D are strongly positive and somewhat higher than those for ordinary capital, while the social returns are even higher, although variable and imprecisely measured in many cases""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Designing climate mitigation policy,Economic theory,"""This paper provides an exhaustive review of critical issues in the design of climate mitigation policy by pulling together key findings and controversies from diverse literatures on mitigation costs, damage valuation, policy instrument choice, technological innovation, and international climate policy.  We begin with the broadest issue of how high assessments suggest the near and medium term price on greenhouse gases would need to be, both under cost-effective stabilization of global climate and under net benefit maximization or Pigouvian emissions pricing.  The remainder of the paper focuses on the appropriate scope of regulation, issues in policy instrument choice, complementary technology policy, and international policy architectures""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Voluntary public goods provision, coalition formation, and uncertainty",Economic theory,"""The literature on voluntary provision of public goods includes recent theoretical work on the formation of voluntary coalitions to provide public goods.  Theory is ambiguous on the equilibrium coalition size and contribution rates.  We examine the emergence of coalitions, their size, and how uncertainty in public goods provision affects contribution levels and coalition size.  We find that contributions decrease when public good returns are uncertain but increase when individuals can form a coalition to provide the good.  Contrary a core theoretical result, we find that coalition size increases when the public good benefits are higher.  Uncertainty has no effect on coalition size""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Hypertension and happiness across nations,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A modern statistical literature argues that countries such as Denmark are particularly happy while nations like East Germany are not. Are such claims credible? The paper explores this by building on two ideas. The first is that psychological well-being and high blood-pressure are thought by clinicians to be inversely correlated. The second is that blood-pressure problems can be reported more objectively than mental well-being. Using data on 16 countries, the paper finds that happier nations report lower levels of hypertension. The paper's results are consistent with, and seem to offer a step towards the validation of, cross-national estimates of well-being""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The perils of globalization offshoring and economic insecurity of the American worker /,Economic theory,"""According to polls from the 2006 congressional elections, globalization and economic insecurity were the primary concerns of many voters.  These Americans apparently believe that they have fallen victim to liberal trade polices and that inexorable trends in globalization are destroying the American Dream.  In this analysis, we use time series cross-section data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to examine the links among offshoring, labor market volatility, and the demand for social insurance.  Unique among the GSS literature, our analysis includes a pseudo-panel model which permits including auxiliary state and regional macroeconomic information""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Nonuniqueness of solutions in applied general equilibrium models with scale economies and imperfect competition,Economic theory,"""Applied general equilibrium models with imperfect competition and economies of scale have been extensively used for analyzing international trade and development policy issues. They offer a natural framework for testing the empirical relevance of propositions from the industrial organization and new trade theoretical literature. This paper warns model builders and users that considerable caution is needed in interpreting the results and deriving strong policy conclusions from these models: in this generation of applied general equilibrium models, nonuniqueness of equilibria is not a theoretical curiosum, but a potentially serious problem.  Disregarding this may lead to dramatically wrong policy appraisals""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
Estimating substitution elasticities in household production models,Economic theory,"""Dynamic general equilibrium models that include explicit household production sectors provide a useful framework within which to analyze a variety of macroeconomic issues. However, some implications of these models depend critically on parameters, including the elasticity of substitution between market and home consumption goods, about which there is little information in the literature. Using the PSID, we estimate these parameters for single males, single females, and married couples. At least for single females and married couples, the results indicate a high enough substitution elasticity that including home production will make a significant difference in applied general equilibrium theory""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
Capacity precommitment as a barrier to entry a bertrand-edgeworth approach /,Economic theory,"""This paper considers the role of capacity as a strategic entry deterrent for a game in which the incumbent and entrant sequentially precommit to capacity levels before competing in price, possibly using mixed strategies. Depending on the magnitudes of the fixed set-up cost, the cost of capacity, and the relative costs of production, the model produces a wide spectrum of equilibrium behaviors, including some not previously suggested in the literature. Interesting deterrence effects occur because firms need time to build. In contrast to much previous work, the incumbent may hold idle capacity when entry is deterred""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
A general method of solution for game theory and its relevance for economic theorizing,Economic theory,"""According to the folklore of economics, game theory has failed.  This paper argues that that is an incorrect interpretation of the game theory literature.  When faced with a well-posed problem, game theory provides a solution.  When faced with an ill-posed problem, game theory fails to provide a solution.  This is, indeed, the best one can hope for from a method of analysis! Further, some suggestions are made for facing game theory with well-posed economic problems""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
Custom made versus ready to wear treatments; behavioral propensities in physician's choices,Economic theory,"""To customize treatments to individual patients entails costs of coordination and cognition.  Thus, providers sometimes choose treatments based on norms for broad classes of patients.  We develop behavioral hypotheses explaining when and why doctors customize to the particular patient, and when instead they employ ""ready-to-wear"" treatments.  Our empirical studies examining length of office visits and physician prescribing behavior find evidence of norm-following behavior.  Some such behavior, from our studies and from the literature, proves sensible; but other behavior seems far from optimal""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The changing nature of wage inequality,Economic theory,"""The paper reviews recent developments in the literature on wage inequality, with a particular focus on why inequality growth has been particularly concentrated in the top end of the wage distribution over the last 15 years.  Several possible institutional and demand-side explanations are discussed for the secular growth in wage inequality in the United States and other advanced industrialized countries.  The paper concludes that three promising explanations for the growth in top-end wage inequality are de-unionization, the increased prevalence of pay for performance, and changes in the relative demand for the types of tasks performed by workers in high-paying occupations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Estimating marginal returns to higher education in the uk,Economic theory,"""A long-standing issue in the literature on education is whether marginal returns to education fall as education rises.  If the population differs in its rate of return, a closely related question is whether marginal returns to higher education fall as a greater fraction of the population enrolls.  This paper proposes a nonparametric method of estimating marginal treatment effects in heterogeneous populations, and applies it to this question, examining returns to higher education in the UK.  The results indicate that marginal returns to higher education fall as the proportion of the population with higher education rises, consistent with the Becker Woytinsky Lecture hypothesis""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Hold-up, asset ownership, and reference points",Economic theory,"""We study two parties who desire a smooth trading relationship under conditions of value and cost uncertainty.  A rigid contract fixing price works well in normal times since there is nothing to argue about.  However, when value or cost is exceptional, one party will hold up the other , damaging the relationship and causing deadweight losses as parties withhold cooperation.  We show that a judicious allocation of asset ownership can help by reducing the incentives to engage in hold up.  In contrast to the literature, the driving force in our model is payoff uncertainty rather than noncontractible investments""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The impact of tax morale and institutional quality on the shadow economy,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper analyses how tax morale and countries' institutional quality affect the shadow economy, controlling in a multivariate analysis for a variety of potential factors. The literature strongly emphasizes the quantitative importance of these factors to understand the level and changes of shadow economy. Relatively new available data sources offer the unique opportunity to shed more light in the understanding of a topic that has received an increased attention. We find strong support that a higher tax morale and a higher institutional quality lead to a smaller shadow economy""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Skill uncertainty and social inference,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Research in psychology indicates that individuals often make inferences regarding unknown individual qualities based on potentially irrelevant (but socially observable) information. This paper explores occupational choices when individuals receive imprecise signals regarding ability and use the observable characteristics of previously successful individuals to infer own ability. Individuals who fail to observe successful predecessors of their same type may underestimate their potential for success in the occupation. We discuss the role of these biases in light of the literature on affirmative action and firm incentives""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Feedback in tournaments under commitment problems theory and experimental evidence /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In this paper, we analyze a principal's optimal feedback policy in tournaments. We close a gap in the literature by assuming the principal to be unable to commit to a certain policy at the beginning of the tournament. Our analysis shows that in equilibrium the principal reveals intermediate information regarding the agents' previous performances if these performances are not too different. Moreover, we investigate a situation where the principal is not able to credibly communicate her information. Having presented our formal analysis, we test these results using data from laboratory experiments. The experimental findings provide some support for the model""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Regional approaches to better standards systems,Finance,"""Developing countries face an increasing need to upgrade the standards of their domestic markets and of their exports.  This paper examines different approaches available to them for upgrading their standards and conformity assessment procedures.  It focuses particularly on those followed within the context of regional trade agreements (RTAs), as these are yielding promising results.  Based on interviews performed in Latin America and on previous literature, the paper draws common features of a RTA standard and conformity assessment upgrading and harmonization process, identifies some of its main challenges, and suggests principles that developing countries could follow in such a process.

Do workers' remittances promote financial development ?,Finance,"""Workers' remittances to developing countries have become the second largest type of flows after foreign direct investment.  The authors use data on workers' remittance flows to 99 developing countries from 1975-2003 to study the impact of remittances on financial sector development.  In particular, they examine whether remittances contribute to increasing the aggregate level of deposits and credit intermediated by the local banking sector.  This is an important question considering the extensive literature that has documented the growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing effects of financial development.  The findings provide strong support for the notion that remittances promote financial development in developing countries. ""--World Bank web site."
Prediction markets in theory and practice,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Prediction Markets, sometimes referred to as ""information markets"", ""idea futures"" or ""event futures"", are markets where participants trade contracts whose payoffs are tied to a future event, thereby yielding prices that can be interpreted as market-aggregated forecasts. This article summarizes the recent literature on prediction markets, highlighting both theoretical contributions that emphasize the possibility that these markets efficiently aggregate disperse information, and the lessons from empirical applications which show that market-generated forecasts typically outperform most moderately sophisticated benchmarks. Along the way, we highlight areas ripe for future research""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Performance pay and risk aversion,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A main prediction of agency theory is the well known risk-incentive trade-off. Incentive contracts should be found in environments with little uncertainty and for agents with low degrees of risk aversion. There is an ongoing debate in the literature about the first trade-off. Due to lack of data, there has so far been hardly any empirical evidence about the second. Making use of a unique representative data set, we find clear evidence that risk aversion has a highly significant and substantial negative impact on the probability that an employee's pay is performance contingent""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Hospital ownership and quality of care what explains the different results? /,Economic theory,"""Does quality of care systematically differ among government-owned, private not-for-profit, and for-profit hospitals? A large empirical literature provides conflicting evidence.  Through quantitative review of 46 studies since 1990, we find that several study features that can explain divergent results: analytic methods, disease studied, and data sources.  For unprofitable care, how studies handle market competition and regional differences account for substantial variation.  Policymakers should be aware that differences in results appear to arise predominantly from differences between studies' analytic methods.  Moreover, conventional methods of meta-analytic synthesis should be applied with great caution given the considerable overlap among studied hospitals""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Belief flipping in a dynamic model of statistical discrimination,Economic theory,"""The literature on statistical discrimination shows that ex-ante identical groups may be differentially treated in discriminatory equilibria.  This paper constructs a dynamic model of statistical discrimination and explores what happens to the individuals who nonetheless overcome the initial discrimination.  If an employer discriminates against a group of workers in her initial hiring, she may actually favor the successful members of that group when she promotes from within the firm.  The worker's welfare implications (i.e.  who benefits from an employer's discriminatory hiring practices) are unclear.  Even though agents face discrimination initially, some may be better off because of it""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Hedonic capital,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper proposes a new way to think about happiness. It distinguishes between stocks and flows. Central to the analysis is a concept we call 'hedonic capital'. The paper sets out a model of the dynamics of wellbeing in which bad life-shocks are smoothed by the drawing down of hedonic capital. The model fits the patterns found in the empirical literature: the existence of a stable level of wellbeing and a tendency to return gradually towards that level. It offers a theory of hedonic adaptation""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Close neighbours matter neighbourhood effects on early performance at school /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Children's outcomes are strongly correlated with those of their neighbours. The extent to which this is causal is the subject of an extensive literature. An identification problem exists because people with similar characteristics are observed to live in close proximity. Another major difficulty is that neighbourhoods measured in available data are often considerably larger than those which matter for outcomes (i.e. close neighbours). Several institutional features of France enable us to address these problems. We find that an adolescent's performance at the end of junior high-school are strongly influenced by the performance of other adolescents in the neighbourhood""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Political institutions, inequality, and agricultural growth the public expenditure connection /",Finance,"""This paper brings together the literatures on the political economy of public expenditures and the determinants of economic growth.  Based on a new dataset of rural public expenditures in a panel of Latin American economies, the econometric evidence suggests that non-social subsidies reduce agricultural GDP.  Furthermore, the evidence suggests that political and institutional factors as well as income inequality are determinants of the size and structure of rural public expenditures, through which they have large and significant effects on agricultural GDP.

Friendship in a public good experiment,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""We conduct a public good experiment with high school teenagers. Some groups exclusively consist of students that we know to be friends. Other groups exclusively consist of students that we know not to be friends, and that are mere classmates. We find that 'friends' contribute more to the public good than 'classmates' do. Contributions of 'classmates' sharply decrease in the last round, in line with the literature on public good experiments. However, contributions of 'friends' sharply increase in the last round""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Solving the stochastic growth model with a finite element method,Economic theory,"""Since it is the dominant paradigm of the business cycle and growth literatures, the stochastic growth model has been used to test the performance of alternative numerical methods. This paper applies the finite element method to this example. I show that the method is easy to apply and, for examples such as the stochastic growth method, gives accurate solutions within a second or two on a desktop computer. I also show how inequality constraints can be handled by redefining the optimization problem with penalty functions""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
Assessing specification errors in stochastic discount factor models,Economic theory,"""In this paper we develop alternative ways to compare asset pricing models when it is understood that their implied stochastic discount factors do not price all portfolios correctly. Unlike comparisons based on chi-squared statistics associated with null hypotheses that models are correct, our measures of model performance do not reward variability of discount factor proxies.  One of our measures is designed to exploit fully the implications of arbitrage-free pricing of derivative claims. We demonstrate empirically the usefulness of methods in assessing some alternative stochastic factor models that have been proposed in asset pricing literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
On the equilibrium concept for overlapping generations organizations,Economic theory,"""A necessary feature for equilibrium is that beliefs about the behavior of other agents are rational. We argue that in stationary OLG environments this implies that any future generation in the same situation as the initial generation must do as well as the initial generation did in that situation. We conclude that the existing equilibrium concepts in the literature do not satisfy this condition. We then propose an alternative equilibrium concept, organizational equilibrium, that satisfies this condition. We show that equilibrium exists, it is unique, and it improves over autarky without achieving optimality. Moreover, the equilibrium can be readily found by solving a maximization program""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
Chasing noise,Economic theory,"""We present a simple model in which rational but uninformed traders occasionally chase noise as if it were information, thereby amplifying sentiment shocks and moving prices away from fundamental values.  We fill a theoretical gap in the literature by showing conditions under which noise traders can have an impact on market equilibrium disproportionate to their size in the market.  The model offers a partial explanation for the surprisingly low market price of financial risk in the Spring of 2007""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Ideological segregation online and offline,Economic theory,"""We use individual and aggregate data to ask how the Internet is changing the ideological segregation of the American electorate.  Focusing on online news consumption, offline news consumption, and face-to-face social interactions, we define ideological segregation in each domain using standard indices from the literature on racial segregation.  We find that ideological segregation of online news consumption is low in absolute terms, higher than the segregation of most offline news consumption, and significantly lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions with neighbors, co-workers, or family members.  We find no evidence that the Internet is becoming more segregated over time""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The performance effects of it-enabled knowledge management practices,Economic theory,"""The extensive literature on knowledge management spans several fields, but there are remarkably few studies that address the basic question as to whether knowledge management practices improve organizational performance.  I examine that question using a national probability sample of establishments, clear measures of IT-driven knowledge management practices, and an experimental design that offers a unique approach for addressing concerns about endogeneity and omitted variables.  The results indicate that the use of company intranets, data warehousing practices, performance support systems, and employee competency databases have significant and meaningful effects on a range of relevant business outcomes""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A state-dependent model of intermediate goods pricing,Economic theory,"""Recent analyses of transaction-level datasets have generated new stylized facts on price setting and greatly influenced the empirical open- and closed-economy macroeconomics literatures.  This work has uncovered marked heterogeneity in price stickiness, demonstrated that even non-zero price changes do not fully ""pass through"" exchange rate shocks, and offered evidence of synchronization in the timing of price changes.  Further, intrafirm prices have been shown to differ from arm's length prices in each of these characteristics.  This paper develops a state-dependent model of intermediate goods pricing, which allows for arm's length and intrafirm transactions, and is capable of generating these empirical pricing patterns""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Are all trade protection policies created equal? empirical evidence for nonequivalent market power effects of tariffs and quotas /,Economic theory,"""Over the past decades, the steel industry has been protected by a wide variety of trade policies, both tariff- and quota-based.  We exploit this extensive heterogeneity in trade protection to examine the well-established theoretical literature predicting nonequivalent effects of tariffs and quotas on domestic firms' market power.  Robust to a variety of empirical specifications with U.S.  Census data on the population of U.S.  steel plants from 1967-2002, we find evidence for significant market power effects for binding quota-based protection, but not for tariff-based protection.  There is only weak evidence that antidumping protection increases market power""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Quality disclosure and certification theory and practice /,Economic theory,"""This essay reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on quality disclosure and certification.  After comparing quality disclosure with other quality assurance mechanisms and describing a brief history of quality disclosure, we address three key theoretical issues: (i) Why don't sellers voluntarily disclose through a process of ""unraveling?"" (ii) When should government mandate disclosure? and (iii) Do certifiers necessarily report unbiased and accurate information? We further review empirical evidence on these issues, with a particular focus on healthcare, education, and finance.

Asset allocation,Economic theory,"""This review article describes recent literature on asset allocation, covering both static and dynamic models.  The article focuses on the bond--stock decision and on the implications of return predictability.  In the static setting, investors are assumed to be Bayesian, and the role of various prior beliefs and specifications of the likelihood are explored.  In the dynamic setting, recursive utility is assumed, and attention is paid to obtaining analytical results when possible.  Results under both full and limited-information assumptions are discussed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Does culture matter?,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews the literature on culture and economics, focusing primarily on the epidemiological approach.  The epidemiological approach studies the variation in outcomes across different immigrant groups residing in the same country.  Immigrants presumably differ in their cultures but share a common institutional and economic environment.  This allows one to separate the effect of culture from the original economic and institutional environment.  This approach has been used to study a variety of issues, including female labor force participaiton, fertility, labor market regulation, redistribution, growth, and financial development among others""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How does the market use citation data? the hirsch index in economics /,Economic theory,"""A large literature following Hirsch (2005) has proposed citation-based indexes that could be used to rank academics.  This paper examines how well several such indexes match labor market outcomes using data on the citation records of young tenured economists at 25 U.S.  departments.  Variants of Hirsch's index that emphasize smaller numbers of highly-cited papers perform better than Hirsch's original index and have substantial power to explain which economists are tenured at which departments.

Are all trade protection policies created equal? empirical evidence for nonequivalent market power effects of tariffs and quotas /,Economic theory,"""Over the past decades, the steel industry has been protected by a wide variety of trade policies, both tariff- and quota-based.  We exploit this extensive heterogeneity in trade protection to examine the well-established theoretical literature predicting nonequivalent effects of tariffs and quotas on domestic firms' market power.  Robust to a variety of empirical specifications with U.S.  Census data on the population of U.S.  steel plants from 1967-2002, we find evidence for significant market power effects for binding quota-based protection, but not for tariff-based protection.  There is only weak evidence that antidumping protection increases market power""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Theories of heterogeneous firms and trade,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews the recent theoretical literature on heterogeneous firms and trade, which emphasizes firm selection into international markets and reallocations of resources across firms.  We discuss the empirical challenges that motivated this research and its relationship to traditional trade theories.  We examine the implications of firm heterogeneity for comparative advantage, market size, aggregate trade, the welfare gains from trade, and the relationship between trade and income distribution.  While a number of studies examine the endogenous response of firm productivity to trade liberalization, modeling internal firm organization and the origins of firm heterogeneity remain interesting areas of ongoing research""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The effect of uncertainty on investment evidence from Texas oil drilling /,Economic theory,"""Despite widespread application of real options theory in the literature, the extent to which firms actually delay irreversible investments following an increase in the uncertainty of their environment is not empirically well-known.  This paper estimates firms' responsiveness to changes in uncertainty using detailed data on oil well drilling in Texas and expectations of future oil price volatility derived from the NYMEX futures options market.  Using a dynamic model of firms' investment problem, I find that oil companies respond to changes in expected price volatility by adjusting their drilling activity by a magnitude consistent with the optimal response prescribed by theory""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Misallocation, economic growth, and input-output economics",Economic theory,"""One of the most important developments in the growth literature of the last decade is the enhanced appreciation of the role that the misallocation of resources plays in helping us understand income differences across countries.  Misallocation at the micro level typically reduces total factor productivity at the macro level.  Quantifying these effects is leading growth researchers in new directions, two examples being the extensive use of firm-level data and the exploration of input-output tables, and promises to yield new insights on why some countries are so much richer than others""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The consequences of financial innovation a counterfactual research agenda /,Economic theory,"""Financial innovation has been both praised as the engine of growth of society and castigated for being the source of the weakness of the economy.  In this paper, we review the literature on financial innovation and highlight the similarities and differences between financial innovation and other forms of innovation.  We also propose a research agenda to systematically address the social welfare implications of financial innovation.  To complement existing empirical and theoretical methods, we propose that scholars examine case studies of systemic (widely adopted) innovations, explicitly considering counterfactual histories had the innovations never been invented or adopted""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A theory-based approach to hedonic price regressions with time-varying unobserved product attributes the price of pollution /,Economic theory,"""We propose a new strategy for a pervasive problem in the hedonics literature-recovering hedonic prices in the presence of time-varying correlated unobservables.  Our approach relies on an assumption about homebuyer rationality, under which prior sales prices can be used to control for time-varying unobservable attributes of the house or neighborhood.  Using housing transactions data from California's Bay Area between 1990 and 2006, we apply our estimator to recover marginal willingness to pay for reductions in three of the EPA's ""criteria"" air pollutants.  Our findings suggest that ignoring bias from time-varying correlated unobservables considerably understates the benefits of a pollution reduction policy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"So you want to run an experiment, now what? some simple rules of thumb for optimal experimental design /",Economic theory,"""Experimental economics represents a strong growth industry.  In the past several decades the method has expanded beyond intellectual curiosity, now meriting consideration alongside the other more traditional empirical approaches used in economics.  Accompanying this growth is an influx of new experimenters who are in need of straightforward direction to make their designs more powerful.  This study provides several simple rules of thumb that researchers can apply to improve the efficiency of their experimental designs.  We buttress these points by including empirical examples from the literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Specialization, outsourcing and wages","Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper studies the impact of outsourcing on individual wages. In contrast to the standard approach in the literature, we focus on domestic outsourcing as well as foreign outsourcing. By using a simple theoretical model, we argue that, if outsourcing is associated with specialization gains arising from an increase in the division of labor, domestic outsourcing tends to increase wages for both unskilled and skilled labor. We use a panel data set of workers in Danish manufacturing industries to show that domestic and foreign outsourcing affect wages as predicted by the theory""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Uncertainty and labor contract durations,Economic theory,"""This paper provides an empirical investigation into the relationship between ex ante U.S. labor contract durations and uncertainty over the period 1970 to 1995.  We construct measures of inflation uncertainty as well as aggregate nominal and real uncertainty.  The results not only corroborate previous findings of an inverse relationship between contract durations and inflation uncertainty, but also document that this relationship extends to both measures of aggregate uncertainty.  We also explore the robustness of this relationship to various measures of inflation uncertainty that have appeared in the literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Testing optimality in job search models,Finance,"""This paper uses Bayesian techniques to compare three definitions of optimality for the basic job search model: the standard income-maximizing definition, an approximation to the standard definition, and a simple alternative.  The important role of prior choice in these comparisons is illustrated.  Using natural conjugate priors to represent hypothetical samples of data, we find that the simple alternative is preferred to the standard definition of optimality.  However, using priors constructed from findings in the literature, we are able to find some evidence in favor of the standard definition of optimality""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
A unified framework for monetary theory and policy analysis,Economic theory,"""Search-theoretic models of monetary exchange are based on explicit descriptions of the frictions that make money essential.  However, tractable versions of these models typically need strong assumptions that make them ill-suited for studying monetary policy.  We propose a framework based on explicit micro foundations within which macro policy can be analyzed.  The model is both analytically tractable and amenable to quantitative analysis.  We demonstrate this by using it to estimate the welfare cost of inflation.  We find much higher costs than the previous literature: our model predicts that going from 10% to 0% inflation can be worth between 3% and 5% of consumption""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
"The determinants of firm performance unions, works councils, and employee involvement/high performance work practices /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""Drawing on evidence from the United States and Germany, this paper offers a survey of the effects of worker representation (in unions and works councils) and innovative work practices on firm performance. The focus is on the growing links between these two historically separate literatures. The interaction between worker representation and high performance work practices provides a practical means of peering inside the black box of collective voice, even if there is as yet no well-determined hierarchy for productivity performance and certainly no blue-print for the future of unions""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Norm enforcement anger, indignation or reciprocity? /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""The enforcement of social norms often requires that unaffected third parties sanction offenders. Given the renewed interest of economists in norms, the literature on third party punishment is surprisingly thin, however. In this paper, we report on the results of an experiment designed to evaluate two distinct explanations for this phenomenon, indignation and group reciprocity. We find evidence in favor of both, with the caveat that the incidence of indignation-driven sanctions is perhaps smaller than earlier studies have hinted. Furthermore, our results suggest that second parties use sanctions to promote conformism while third parties intervene primarily to promote efficiency""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
International outsourcing and incomplete contracts,Economic theory,"""International outsourcing to lower cost countries such as China and India can best be understood through the enrichment of trade models to include concepts from industrial organization and contract theory that explain the vertical organization of production.  The combination of trade with the choice of organizational form represents an important new area for both theoretical and empirical research.  This survey paper provides a perspective on this new literature so as to gain insights into the forces driving international outsourcing.  The paper focuses on relationship-specific investment, incomplete contracts, and also search and matching, as fundamental concepts that explain outsourcing decisions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Behavioral public economics welfare and policy analysis with non-standard decision-makers /,Economic theory,"""This paper has two goals.  First, we discuss several emerging approaches to applied welfare analysis under non-standard (""behavioral"") assumptions concerning consumer choice.  This provides a foundation for Behavioral Public Economics.  Second, we illustrate applications of these approaches by surveying behavioral studies of policy problems involving saving, addiction, and public goods.  We argue that the literature on behavioral public economics, though in its infancy, has already fundamentally changed our understanding of public policy in each of these domains""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Cross-country empirical studies of systemic bank distress a survey /,Finance,"""A rapidly growing empirical literature is studying the causes and consequences of bank fragility in contemporary economies.  The authors reviews the two basic methodologies adopted in cross-country empirical studies-the signals approach and the multivariate probability model-and their application to study the determinants of banking crises.

"Exporting firms do not pay higher wages, ceteris paribus first evidence from linked employer-employee data /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""18 studies using data from 20 highly developed, developing, and less developed countries document that average wages in exporting firms are higher than in non-exporting firms from the same industry and region. The existence of these so-called exporter wage premia is one of the stylized facts found in the emerging literature on the microeconometrics of international trade. This paper uses a large and rich set of linked employer-employee data from Germany to demonstrate that these premia vanish when individual characteristics of the employees and of the work place are controlled for""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Labour and product market reforms a case for policy complementarity /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper is a contribution to the debate on policy complementarity in relation to deregulation in the product and labour markets. We develop a model of dynamic efficiency wages and monopolistic competition. Whereas most of the literature points toward the gains associated to an increase in product market competition coupled with an increased flexibility of the labour market, we show that even when more product market competition is the policy recommendation, it should be accompanied by an increase in job security""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Aggregate unemployment in Krusell and Smith's economy a note /,Economic theory,"""Using data on workers' flows into and out of employment, unemployment, and not-in-the-labor-force, I construct transition probabilities between ""employment"" and ""unemployment"" that can be used in the calibration of economies such as Krusell and Smith's (1998).  I show that calibration in Krusell and Smith has some counterfactual features.  Yet the gains from adopting alternative calibrations in terms of matching the data are not very large, unless one assumes that the duration of unemployment spells is well above what is usually assumed in the literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Do casinos export bankruptcy?,Economic theory,"""This paper measures the extent to which destination resort casinos export bankruptcy back to visitors' home states.  Previous literature has alluded to this possibility, but to date studies have only examined the influence of local casinos on local bankruptcy.  Using various survey data, we calculate the number of visits from each state to casino resort destinations in Nevada, New Jersey, and Mississippi.  We find strong evidence that states having more residents who visit out-of-state casino resorts have higher bankruptcy filings.  This effect is dominant in the south, suggesting that casinos located in wealthier regions are less likely to export bankruptcy""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
The delinquency of subprime mortgages,Economic theory,"""This paper focuses on understanding the determinants of the performance of subprime mortgages.  A growing body of literature recognizes the substantial lag between the time that a borrower stops making payments on a mortgage and the termination of the loan.  The duration of this lag and the method by which the delinquency is ultimately terminated play a critical role in the costs borne by both borrower and lender.  Using nested and multinomial logit, we find that delinquency and default are sensitive to current economic conditions and housing markets.  Credit scores and loan characteristics also play important roles""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Determinants of business cycle comovement a robust analysis /,Economic theory,"""This paper investigates the determinants of business cycle comovement between countries.  Our dataset includes over 100 countries, both developed and developing.  We search for variables that are robust' in explaining comovement, using the approach of Leamer (1983).  Variables considered are (i) bilateral trade between countries; (ii) total trade in each country; (iii) sectoral structure; (iv) similarity in export and import baskets; (v) factor endowments; and (vi) gravity variables.  We find that bilateral trade is robust.  However, two variables that the literature has argued are important for business cycles industrial structure and currency unions are found not to be robust""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
FDI in space spatial autoregressive relationships in foreign direct investment /,Economic theory,"""Theoretical models of foreign direct investment (FDI) have only recently begun to model the role of third countries, and the empirical FDI literature has almost exclusively examined bilateral FDI data without recognizing the potential interdependence between FDI decisions to alternative host countries.  This paper uses spatial econometric techniques to examine the spatial correlation between FDI to alternative (neighboring) regions.  The sign of such correlations can provide evidence for or against alternative theories for FDI motivations.  Using data on OECD countries from 1980-2000, we find evidence consistent with export platform FDI in Europe""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Subjective outcomes in economics,Economic theory,"""This study examines the various uses of subjective outcomes as a focus of interest for economists.  It outlines the possible channels by which economists can usefully add to what are already massive literatures on such outcomes in the other social sciences.  Generally we contribute little if we merely engage in fancier empirical work and still less if we describe subjective outcomes by other subjective outcomes.  Our biggest contributions can be in adducing economic theories that allow a better understanding of objective behavior using subjective outcomes, or of the determinants of subjective outcomes; or in understanding subjective outcomes, such as expectations, that underlie objective economic behavior""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"When does financial liberalization make banks risky? an empirical examination of Argentina, Canada and Mexico /",Economic theory,"""In the literature on systemic banking crises, two common themes are: (1) lack of market discipline encourages risky lending and (2) financial liberalization or privatization lead to risky lending. However, there is evidence to suggest that neither financial liberalization nor weak market discipline always precedes risky lending. We test for depositor discipline and, separately for post-liberalization or post-privatization risky lending in Argentina, Canada, and Mexico. In the countries without market discipline, lending risk increases significantly in the wake of liberalization. Where depositors discipline banks, banks neither behave riskily nor does their risk increase in the wake of privatization""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site."
Housing demand and community choice an empirical analysis /,Economic theory,"""Housing demand reflects the household's simultaneous choice of neighborhood, whether to own or rent the dwelling, and the quantity of housing services demanded.  Existing literature emphasizes the final two factors, but overlooks the choice of community.  This paper develops an econometric model that incorporates all three components, and then estimates this model using a sample of households in Tampa, Florida.  Incorporating community choice increases the price elasticity of demand and reduces the differential between white and comparable nonwhite households.  The results are robust to the inclusion of permanent income and taxes""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Aggregate supply and potential output,Economic theory,"""The New-Keynesian aggregate supply derives from micro-foundations an inflation-dynamics model very much like the tradition in the monetary literature.  Inflation is primarily affected by: (i) economic slack; (ii) expectations; (iii) supply shocks; and (iv) inflation persistence.  This paper extends the New Keynesian aggregate supply relationship to include also fluctuations in potential output, as an additional determinant of the relationship.  Implications for monetary rules and to the estimation of the Phillips curve are pointed out""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
What you don't know can't help you pension knowledge and retirement decision making /,Economic theory,"""This paper provides an answer to an important empirical puzzle in the retirement literature: while most people know little about their own pension plans, retirement behavior is strongly affected by pension incentives.  We combine administrative and self-reported pension data to measure the retirement response to actual and perceived financial incentives.  We find that well-informed individuals are five times more responsive to pension incentives than the average individual when knowledge is ignored.  We further find that the ill-informed individuals do respond to their own misperception of the incentives, rather than being unresponsive to any incentives""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The simple geometry of transmission and stabilization in closed and open economies,Economic theory,"""This paper provides an introduction to the recent literature on macroeconomic stabilization in closed and open economies.  We present a stylized theoretical framework, illustrating its main properties with the help of an intuitive graphical apparatus.  Among the issues we discuss are optimal monetary policy and the welfare gains from macroeconomic stabilization, the international transmission of real and monetary shocks and the role of exchange rate pass-through, and the design of optimal exchange rate regimes and monetary coordination among interdependent economies""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
On the timing of innovation in stochastic Schumpeterian growth models,Economic theory,"""Recent work has revived the Schumpeterian hypothesis that recessions facilitate innovation and growth.  But a major source of productivity growth, research and development, is actually procyclical.  This paper argues that while it is optimal to concentrate growth-enhancing activities in downturns, dynamic spillovers inherent to the R&D process lead private agents to concentrate too much of their R&D activity in booms, precisely when its social cost is highest.  Thus, while previous literature has argued recessions promote growth and intertemporal substitution is a desirable consequence of fluctuations, in the case of R&D recessions discourage growth and intertemporal substitution proves to be a social liability""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Unbiased estimation of the half-life to ppp convergence in panel data,Economic theory,"""Three potential sources of bias present complications for estimating the half-life of purchasing power parity deviations from panel data.  They are the bias associated with inapproiate aggregation across heterogeneous coefficients, time aggregation of commodity prices, and downward bias in estimation of dynamic lag coefficients.  Each of these biases have been addressed individually in the literature.  In this paper, we address all three biases in arriving at our estimates.  Analyzing an annual panel data set of real exchange rates for 21 OECD countries from 1948 to 2002, our point estimate of the half-life is 5.5 years""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A model of (the threat of) counterfeiting,Economic theory,"""A simple matching-model of money with the potential for counterfeiting is constructed.  In contrast to the existing literature, counterfeiting, if it occurred, would be accompanied by two distortions: costly production of counterfeits and harmful effects on trade.  However, application of the Cho-Kreps refinement is shown to imply that there is no equilibrium with counterfeiting.  If the cost of producing counterfeits is low enough, then there is no monetary equilibrium.  Otherwise, there is a monetary equilibrium without counterfeiting""--Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond web site."

Monetary policy in a Markov-switching VECM implications for the cost of disinflation and the price puzzle /,Economic theory,"""Monetary policy VARs typically presume stability of the long-run outcomes.  We introduce the possibility of switches in the long-run equilibrium in a cointegrated VAR by allowing both the covariance matrix and weighting matrix in the error-correction term to switch.  We find that monetary policy alternates between sustaining long-run growth and disinflationary regimes.  Allowing state changes can also help explain the price puzzle and justify the use of commodity prices as a corrective measure.  Finally, we show that regime-switching has implications for disinflationary monetary policy and can explain the variety of sacrifice ratio estimates that exist in the literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Entrepreneurship and the policy environment,Economic theory,"""This paper uses a spatial panel approach to examine the effect of the government-policy environment on the level of entrepreneurship.  Specifically, we investigate whether marginal income tax rates and bankruptcy exemptions influence rates of entrepreneurship.  Whereas previous work in the literature finds that both policies are positively related to entrepreneurship, we find non-monotonic relationships: a U-shaped relationship between marginal tax rates and entrepreneurship and an S-shaped relationship between bankruptcy exemptions and entrepreneurship""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
On the equilibrium concept for overlapping generations organizations,Economic theory,"""A necessary feature for equilibrium is that beliefs about the behavior of other agents are rational.We argue that in stationary OLG environments this implies that any future generation in the same situation as the initial generation must do as well as the initial generation did in that situation.We conclude that the existing equilibrium concepts in the literature do not satisfy this condition.We then propose an alternative equilibrium concept, organizational equilibrium, that satisfies this condition.We show that equilibrium exists, it is unique, and it improves over autarky without achieving optimality.Moreover, the equilibrium can be readily found by solving a maximization program""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
"""Beggar-thy-neighbor"" or ""Beggar-thyself""? the income effect of exchange rate fluctuations /",Economic theory,"""This paper analyzes the impact of exchange rate fluctuations when they are only partially passed through to consumer prices.  We show that an exchange rate depreciation does not necessarily have a beggar-thy-neighbor effect and may in fact have an opposite, or beggar-thyself, effect.

Modeling bond yields in finance and macroeconomics,Economic theory,"""From a macroeconomic perspective, the short-term interest rate is a policy instrument under the direct control of the central bank.  From a finance perspective, long rates are risk-adjusted averages of expected future short rates.  Thus, as illustrated by much recent research, a joint macro-finance modeling strategy will provide the most comprehensive understanding of the term structure of interest rates.  We discuss various questions that arise in this research, and we also present a new examination of the relationship between two prominent dynamic, latent factor models in this literature: the Nelson-Siegel and affne no-arbitrage term structure models""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How unobservable productivity biases the value of a statistical life,Economic theory,"""A prominent theoretical controversy in the compensating differentials literature concerns unobservable individual productivity.  Competing models yield opposite predictions depending on whether the unobservable productivity is safety-related skill or productivity generally.  Using five panel waves and several new measures of worker fatality risks, first-difference estimates imply that omitting individual heterogeneity leads to overestimates of the value of statistical life, consistent with the latent safety-related skill interpretation.  Risk measures with less measurement error raise the value of statistical life, the net effect being that estimates from the static model range from $5.3 million to $6.7 million, with dynamic model estimates somewhat higher""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Law and firms' access to finance,Economic theory,"""This paper contributes to the literature on how a country's legal origin influences the operation of its financial system by using firm-level survey data on the obstacles that firms face in raising external finance.  The paper assesses two channels through which legal origin may influence the financial system.  It finds that the adaptability of a country's legal system is more important for explaining the obstacles that firms face in accessing external finance than the political independence of the judiciary""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Does female schooling reduce fertility? evidence from Nigeria /,Economic theory,"""The literature generally points to a negative relationship between female education and fertility.  Citing this pattern, policymakers have advocated educating girls and young women as a means to reduce population growth and foster sustained economic and social welfare in developing countries.  This paper tests whether the relationship between fertility and education is indeed causal by investigating the introduction of universal primary education in Nigeria.  Exploiting differences by region and age, the paper uses differences-in-differences and instrumental variables to estimate the role of education in fertility.  The analysis suggests that increasing education by one year reduces fertility by 0.26 births""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Global distortions to agricultural markets new indicators of trade and welfare impacts, 1955 to 2007 /",Finance,"""Despite recent reforms, world agricultural markets remain highly distorted by government policies.  Traditional indicators of those price distortions can be poor guides to the policies' economic effects.  Recent theoretical literature provides indicators of trade and welfare-reducing effects of price and trade policies which this paper builds on to develop more-satisfactory indexes.  The authors exploit a new Agricultural Distortion database to generate estimates of them for developing and high-income countries over the past half century.  These better approximations of the trade and welfare effects of sector policies are generated without a formal model of global markets or even price elasticity estimates. ""--World Bank web site."
Why do borrowers pledge collateral? new empirical evidence on the role of asymmetric information /,Economic theory,"""An impressive theoretical literature motivates collateral as a mechanism that reduces equilibrium credit rationing and other problems arising from asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders.  However, no clear empirical evidence exists regarding the theory's central implication: that reducing asymmetric information reduces the incidence of collateral.  We provide such evidence by exploiting exogenous variation in lender information sets related to their adoption of a new information technology and by comparing collateral outcomes before and after adoption.  Our results are consistent with the central implication of the theoretical models and may also have efficiency and macroeconomic implications""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Information criteria for impulse response function matching estimation of DSGE models,Economic theory,"""We propose a new information criterion for impulse response function matching estimators of the structural parameters of macroeconomic models.  The main advantage of our procedure is that it allows the researcher to select the impulse responses that are most informative about the deep parameters, therefore reducing the bias and improving the efficiency of the estimates of the model's parameters.  We show that our method substantially changes key parameter estimates of representative dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, thus reconciling their empirical results with the existing literature.  Our criterion is general enough to apply to impulse responses estimated by vector autoregressions, local projections, and simulation methods""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Smoking : taxing health and social security /,Economic theory,"""While the health risks associated with smoking are well known, the impact on income distributions is not. This paper extends the literature by examining the distributional effects of a behavioral choice, in this case smoking, on net marginal Social Security tax rates (NMSSTR). The results show that smokers, as a result of shorter life expectancies, incur a higher NMSSTR than nonsmokers. In addition, as low-earnings workers have a higher smoking prevalence than high-earnings workers, smoking works to widen the income distribution. This higher tax rate could have implications for both labor supply behavior and Social Security system funding. ""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
The chicken or the egg? endogeneity in labour market participation of informal carers in England /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Informal care is a vital pillar of the British welfare state. A well-known fact in the small economic literature on informal care is the apparent negative relation between care responsibilities and labour market participation. Yet, caring and labour market participation may be endogenous. Using an instrumental variable approach and data from the British Household Panel Study for 2002 this paper shows that not accommodating for endogeneity in the labour market participation equation may significantly underestimate the impact care exhibits on the employment decision of informal carers. This is the more the case the smaller the choice of becoming a carer. Policy implications are derived""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Peer effects and textbooks in primary education evidence from francophone Sub-Saharan Africa /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""As opposed to many other school inputs, textbooks have frequently been demonstrated to significantly foster student achievement. Using the rich data set provided by the 'Program on the Analysis of Education Systems' (PASEC) for five francophone, Sub-Saharan African countries, this paper goes beyond the estimation of direct effects of textbooks on students' learning and focuses on peer effects resulting from textbooks owned by students' classmates. Applying and extending nonparametric estimation methods from the treatment evaluation literature we separate the direct effect of textbooks from their peer effect. The latter clearly dominates but depends upon the initial level of textbook availability""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
On the contribution of demographic change to aggregate poverty measures for the developing world,Finance,"""Recent literature and new data help determine plausible bounds to some key demographic differences between the poor and non-poor in the developing world.  The author estimates that selective mortality-whereby poorer people tend to have higher death rates-accounts for 10-30 percent of the developing world's trend rate of ""$1 a day"" poverty reduction in the 1990s.  However, in a neighborhood of plausible estimates, differential fertility-whereby poorer people tend also to have higher birth rates-has had a more than offsetting poverty-increasing effect.  The net impact of differential natural population growth represents 10-50 percent of the trend rate of poverty reduction. ""--World Bank web site."
Judicial lobbying the politics of labor law constitutional interpretation /,Economic theory,"""This paper links the theory of interest groups influence over the legislature with that of congressional control over the judiciary.  The resulting framework reconciles the theoretical literature of lobbying with the negative available evidence on the impact of lobbying over legislative outcomes, and sheds light to the determinants of lobbying in separation-of-powers systems.  We provide conditions for judicial decisions to be sensitive to legislative lobbying, and find that lobbying falls the more divided the legislature is on the relevant issues.  We apply this framework to analyze supreme court labor decisions in Argentina, and find results consistent with the predictions of the theory""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

The evidence is consistent with increases in market power from some types of consolidation; improvements in profit efficiency and diversification of risks, but little or no cost efficiency improvements on average; relatively little effect on the availability of services to small customers; potential improvements in payments system efficiency; and potential costs on the financial system from increasing systemic risk or expanding the financial safety net""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."

Focusing on the most influential estimates of the expansions' impact, I show that while many of the critiques leveled at these estimates have little effect on their magnitude, accounting for age-specific trends in coverage produces estimates similar to others in the literature.  Estimating the impact of later expansions using additional years of data, I find low rates of take-up and no evidence of crowding out""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Do women in top management affect firm performance? a panel study of 2500 Danish firms,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Corporate governance literature argues that board diversity is potentially positively related to firm performance. This study examines the relationship in the case of women in top executive jobs and on boards of directors. We use data for the 2500 largest Danish firms observed during the period 1993-2001 and find that the proportion of women in top management jobs tends to have positive effects on firm performance, even after controlling for numerous characteristics of the firm and direction of causality. The results show that the positive effects of women in top management depend on the qualifications of female top managers""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Exports and labour demand searching for functional structure in multi-output multi-skill technologies /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In order to simplify the representation of a technological relationship between inputs and outputs, a production unit's technology must typically satisfy some restrictive conditions, some of them being well known in the literature. This paper presents new results for aggregating labour inputs and outputs, in terms of restrictions on elasticities of scale and substitution. These conditions are then empirically investigated, in a framework that is flexible and does not lose its flexibility after separability being imposed. The empirical findings of the exact approach to aggregation are found to be rather pessimistic on the possibility to provide a simplified representation""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

The present paper explores the sources of the gender differential in training incidence using Labour Force Survey data, updating previous U.K. studies and providing further insights into the above phenomenon. The results suggest that the greater part of the gap typically relates to differences in characteristics, among which the most important relate to occupation, industry and sector (public/private)""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

"Traded and nontraded goods prices, and international risk sharing an empirical investigation. /",Economic theory,"""Accounting for the pervasive evidence of limited international risk sharing is an important hurdle for open-economy models, especially when these are adopted in the analysis of policy trade-offs likely to be affected by imperfections in financial markets.  Key to the literature is the evidence, at odds with efficiency, that consumption is relatively high in countries where its international relative price (the real exchange rate) is also high.  We reconsider the relation between cross-country consumption differentials and real exchange rates, by decomposing it into two components, reflecting the prices of tradable and nontradable goods, respectively.  We document that, as a common pattern among OECD countries, both components tend to contribute to the overall lack of risk sharing, with the tradable price component playing the dominant role in accounting for efficiency deviations.  We relate these findings to two mechanisms proposed by the literature to reconcile open economy models with the data.  One features strong Balassa-Samuelson effects on nontradable prices due to productivity gains in the tradable sector, with a muted offsetting response of tradable prices.  The other, endogenous income effects causing nontradable but especially tradable prices to appreciate with a rise in domestic consumption demand""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The economics and politics of women's rights,Economic theory,"""Women's rights and economic development are highly correlated.  Today, the discrepancy between the legal rights of women and men is much larger in developing compared to developed countries.  Historically, even in countries that are now rich women had few rights before economic development took off.  Is development the cause of expanding women's rights, or conversely, do women's rights facilitate development? We argue that there is truth to both hypotheses.  The literature on the economic consequences of women's rights documents that more rights for women lead to more spending on health and children, which should benefit development.  The political-economy literature on the evolution of women's rights finds that technological change increased the costs of patriarchy for men, and thus contributed to expanding women's rights.  Combining these perspectives, we discuss the theory of Doepke and Tertilt (2009), where an increase in the return to human capital induces men to vote for women's rights, which in turn promotes growth in human capital and income per capita""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Education and labor market consequences of teenage childbearing evidence using the timing of pregnancy outcomes and community fixed effects /,Economic theory,"""The question of whether giving birth as a teenager has negative economic consequences for the mother remains controversial despite substantial research.  In this paper, we build upon existing literature, especially the literature that uses the experience of teenagers who had a miscarriage as the appropriate comparison group.  We show that miscarriages are not random events, but rather are likely correlated with (unobserved) community-level factors, casting some doubt on previous findings.  Including community-level fixed effects in our specifications lead to important changes in our estimates.  By making use of information on the timing of miscarriages as well as birth control choices preceding the teenage pregnancies we construct more relevant control groups for teenage mothers.  We find evidence that teenage childbearing likely reduces the probability of receiving a high school diploma by 5 to 10 percentage points, reduces annual income as a young adult by $1,000 to $2,400, and may increase the probability of receiving cash assistance and decrease years of schooling""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Pitfalls in estimating asymmetric effects of energy price shocks,Finance,"""A common view in the literature is that the effect of energy price shocks on macroeconomic aggregates is asymmetric in energy price increases and decreases.  We show that widely used asymmetric vector autoregressive models of the transmission of energy price shocks are misspecified, resulting in inconsistent parameter estimates, and that the implied impulse responses have been routinely computed incorrectly.  As a result, the quantitative importance of unanticipated energy price increases for the U.S.  economy has been exaggerated.  In response to this problem, we develop alternative regression models and methods of computing responses to energy price shocks that yield consistent estimates regardless of the degree of asymmetry.  We also introduce improved tests of the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to energy price increases and decreases.  An empirical study reveals little evidence against the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to energy price shocks.  Our analysis also has direct implications for the theoretical literature on the transmission of energy price shocks and for the debate about policy responses to energy price shocks""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Droughts, floods and financial distress in the United States",Economic theory,"""The relationships among the weather, agricultural markets, and financial markets have long been of interest to economic historians, but relatively little empirical work has been done.  We push this literature forward by using modern drought indexes, which are available in detail over a wide area and for long periods of time to perform a battery of tests on the relationship between these indexes and sensitive indicators of financial stress.  The drought indexes were devised by climate historians from instrument records and tree rings, and because they are unfamiliar to most economic historians and economists, we briefly describe the methodology.  The financial literature in the area can be traced to William Stanley Jevons, who connected his sun spot theory to rainfall patterns.  The Dust bowl of the 1930s brought the climate-finance link to the attention of the general public.  Here we assemble new evidence to test various hypotheses involving the impact of extreme swings in moisture on financial stress""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Generalized agency problems,Economic theory,"""Agency problems in economics virtually always entail self-interested agency exhibiting ""insufficient"" loyalty to principal.  Social psychology also has a literature, mainly derived from work by Stanley Milgram, on issues of agency, but this emphasizes excessive loyalty -- people undergoing a so-called ""agentic shift"" and forsaking rationality for loyalty to a legitimate principal, as when ""loyal"" soldiers obey orders to commit atrocities.  This literature posit that individuals experience a deep inner satisfaction from acts of loyalty -- essentially a ""utility of loyalty"" -- and that this both buttresses institutions organized as hierarchies and explains much human misery.  Agency problems of excessive loyalty, as when boards kowtow to errant CEOs and controlling shareholders, may be as economically important in corporate finance as the more familiar problems of insufficient loyalty of corporate insiders to shareholders.  Overt conflict between rival authorities is shown to reverse the ""agentic shift"" -- justifying institutions that formalize argumentation such as the adversary system in Common Law courts; the Official Opposition in Westminster democracies; discussants and referees in academia; and independent directors, non-executive chairs, and proxy contests in corporate governance""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Crowding out and crowding in of private donations and government grants,Economic theory,"""A large literature examines the interaction of private and public funding of public goods and charities, much of it testing if public funding crowds out private funding.  This paper makes two contributions to this literature.  First, the crowding out effect could also occur in the opposite direction: in response to the level of private contributions, the government may alter its funding.  I model how crowding out can manifest in both directions.  Second, with asymmetric information about the quality of a public good, one source of funding may act as a signal about that quality and crowd in the other source of funding.  I test for crowding out or crowding in either direction using a large panel data set gathered from nonprofit organizations' tax returns.  I find strong evidence that government grants crowd in private donations, consistent with the signaling model.  Regression point estimates indicate that private donations crowd out government grants, but they are not statistically significant""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Immigrants assimilate as communities, not just as individuals","Industries, Land use, Labor","""There is a large econometric literature that examines the economic assimilation of immigrants in the United States and elsewhere. On the whole immigrants are seen as atomistic individuals assimilating in a largely anonymous labour market, a view that runs counter to the spirit of the equally large literature on ethnic groups. Here we argue that immigrants assimilate as communities, not just as individuals. The longer the immigrant community has been established the better adjusted it is to the host society and the more the host society comes to accept that ethnic group. Thus economic outcomes for immigrants should depend not just on their own characteristics, but also on the legacy of past immigration from the same country. In this paper we test this hypothesis using data from a 5 percent sample of the 1980, 1990 and 2000 US censuses. We find that history matters in immigrant assimilation: the stronger is the tradition of immigration from a given source country, the better the economic outcomes for new immigrants from that source""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Does reform work? an econometric examination of the reform-growth puzzle,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Why are socially beneficial reforms not implemented? One simple answer to this question (which has received little attention in the literature) is that this may be caused by generalized uncertainty about the effectiveness of reforms. If agents are unsure about whether a proposed reform will work, it will be less likely to be adopted. Despite the numerous benefits economists assign to structural reforms, the empirical literature has thus far failed to establish a positive and significant effect of reforms on economic performance. We collect data from 43 econometric studies (for more than 300 coefficients on the effects of reform on growth) and show that approximately one third of these coefficients is positive and significant, another third is negative and significant, and the final third is not statistically significant different from zero. In trying to understand this remarkable variation, we find that the measurement of reform and controlling for institutions and initial conditions are main factors in decreasing the probability of reporting a significant and positive effect of reform on growth""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Optimal fiscal policy in the design of social security reforms,Economic theory,"""The quantitative macroeconomics literature has documented that in the basic Overlapping Generations model a privatization of the social security system, going from a Pay-As-You-Go to a Fully Funded system, generates large long run welfare gains at the cost of substantial welfare losses for initial generations.  We propose an alternative to previous literature.  In this paper we maximize over the entire policy space, following the optimal fiscal policy approach, rather than comparing alternative policy paths one to one.  That is, policies are chosen as part of the optimal design of a social security privatization in a Pareto improving way.  The government decides endogenously how to finance the implicit social security liabilities and compensate the initial generations alive during the transition.  In contrast with previous analysis the resulting allocation, by construction, lies on the constrained Pareto frontier.  We find that the optimal design of reforms exhibits sizeable welfare gains, arising because of the reduction in labor supply distortions.  In contrast, the welfare gains coming from the reduction of savings distortions are relatively small""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Corruption and trade protection evidence from panel data /,Economic theory,"""This paper provides new estimates of the effects of corruption and poor institutions on trade protection.  It exploits data on several measures of trade protection including import duty, international trade taxes, and the trade-GDP ratio.  The paper complements the literature on the relationship between corruption and trade reform.  It deviates from the previous literature in several ways.  First, unobserved heterogeneity among countries have been controlled with properly specified fixed effects exploiting the time dimension present in the dataset.  Secondly, instead of using tariff and non-tariff barriers, more general measures of trade protection have been used.  The issue of endogeneity of corruption with respect to trade policy has been addressed using proper instruments for corruption used in previous studies.  Moreover, two separate institutional measures have been used in the same regression to estimate their comparative impacts on trade policy.  In general, we find that corruption and lack of contract enforcement have strong impacts to increase trade protection and negative effects on trade openness""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Is unemployment more costly than inflation?,Economic theory,"""Previous literature has found that both unemployment and inflation lower happiness.  This paper extends the literature by looking at more countries over a longer time period.  It also considers the impacts on happiness of GDP per capita and interest rates.  I find, conventionally, that both higher unemployment and higher inflation lower happiness.  Interest rates are also found to enter happiness equations negatively.  Changes in GDP per capita have little impact on more economically developed countries, but do have a positive impact in the poorest countries -- consistent with the Easterlin hypothesis.  I find that unemployment depresses well-being more than inflation.  The least educated and the old are more concerned about unemployment than inflation.  Conversely, the young and the most educated are more concerned about inflation.  An individual's experience of high inflation over their adult lifetime lowers their current happiness over and above the effects from inflation and unemployment.  Unemployment appears to be more costly than inflation in terms of its impact on wellbeing""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Noisy macroeconomic announcements, monetary policy, and asset prices",Economic theory,"""The current literature has provided a number of important insights about the effects of macroeconomic data releases on monetary policy expectations and asset prices.  However, one puzzling aspect of that literature is that the estimated responses are quite small.  Indeed, these studies typically find that the major economic releases, taken together, account for only a small amount of the variation in asset prices even those closely tied to near-term policy expectations.  In this paper we argue that this apparent detachment arises in part from the difficulties associated with measuring macroeconomic news.  We propose two new econometric approaches that allow us to account for the noise in measured data surprises.  Using these estimators, we find that asset prices and monetary policy expectations are much more responsive to incoming news than previously believed.  Our results also clarify the set of facts that should be captured by any model attempting to understand the interactions between economic data, monetary policy, and asset prices""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Buy, lobby or sue interest groups' participation in policy making - a selective survey /",Economic theory,"""The participation of interest groups in public policy making is unavoidable.  Its unavoidable nature is only matched by the universal suspicion with which it has been seen by both policy makers and the public.  Recently, however, there has been a growing literature that examines the participation of interest groups in public policy making from a New Institutional Economics perspective.  The distinguishing feature of the New Institutional Economics Approach is its emphasis in opening up the black box of decision-making, whether in understanding the rules of the game, or the play of the game.  In this paper we do not attempt to fairly describe the vast literature on interest group's behavior.  Instead, the purpose of this essay for the New Institutional Economics Guide Book is to review recent papers that follow the NIE mantra.  That is, they attempt to explicate the micro-analytic features of the way interest groups actually interact with policy-makers, rather than providing an abstract high-level representation.  We emphasize the role of the institutional environment in understanding interest groups' strategies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Explaining cross-country income differences,Economic theory,"""This chapter reviews the literature that tries to explain the disparity and variation of GDP per worker and GDP per capita across countries and across time. There are many potential explanations for the different patterns of development across countries, including differences in luck, raw materials, geography, preferences, and economic policies. We focus on differences in economic policies and ask to what extent can differences in policies across countries account for the observed variability in income levels and their growth rates. We review estimates for a wide range of policy variables. In many cases, the magnitude of the estimates is under debate. Estimates found by running cross-sectional growth regressions are sensitive to which variables are included as explanatory variables.  Estimates found using quantitative theory depend in critical ways on values of parameters and measures of factor inputs for which there is little consensus. In this chapter, we review the ongoing debates of the literature and the progress that has been made thus far""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
The GED,Economic theory,"""The General Educational Development (GED) credential is issued on the basis of an eight hour subject-based test.  The test claims to establish equivalence between dropouts and traditional high school graduates, opening the door to college and positions in the labor market.  In 2008 alone, almost 500,000 dropouts passed the test, amounting to 12% of all high school credentials issued in that year.  This chapter reviews the academic literature on the GED, which finds minimal value of the certificate in terms of labor market outcomes and that only a few individuals successfully use it as a path to obtain post-secondary credentials.  Although the GED establishes cognitive equivalence on one measure of scholastic aptitude, recipients still face limited opportunity due to deficits in noncognitive skills such as persistence, motivation and reliability.  The literature finds that the GED testing program distorts social statistics on high school completion rates, minority graduation gaps, and sources of wage growth.  Recent work demonstrates that, through its availability and low cost, the GED also induces some students to drop out of school.  The GED program is unique to the United States and Canada, but provides policy insight relevant to any nation's educational context""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
In search of real rigidities,Economic theory,"""The closed and open economy literatures work on evaluating the role of real rigidities, but in parallel.  This paper brings the two literatures together.  We use international price data and exchange rate shocks to evaluate the importance of real rigidities in price setting.  We show that consistent with the presence of real rigidities the response of reset-price inflation to exchange rate shocks depicts significant persistence.  Individual import prices, conditional on changing, respond to exchange rate shocks prior to the last price change.  At the same time aggregate reset-price inflation for imports, like that for consumer prices, depicts little persistence.  Competitor prices affect firm pricing, and exchange rate pass-through into import prices is greater in response to trade-weighted as opposed to bilateral exchange rate shocks.  We quantitatively evaluate sticky price models (Calvo and menu cost) with variable markups at the wholesale level and constant markups at the retail level, consistent with empirical evidence.  Variable markups alone generate price sluggishness at the aggregate level, while they fall short of matching price persistence at the micro level.  Finally, variable markups magnify the size of the contract multiplier, but their absolute effects are modest unless they are coupled with exogenous sources of persistence""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Earnings, consumption and lifecycle choices",Economic theory,"""We discuss recent developments in the literature that studies how the dynamics of earnings and wages affect consumption choices over the life cycle.  We start by analyzing the theoretical impact of income changes on consumption - highlighting the role of persistence, information, size and insurability of changes in economic resources.  We next examine the empirical contributions, distinguishing between papers that use only income data and those that use both income and consumption data.  The latter do this for two purposes.  First, one can make explicit assumptions about the structure of credit and insurance markets and identify the income process or the information set of the individuals.  Second, one can assume that the income process or the amount of information that consumers have are known and tests the implications of the theory.  In general there is an identification issue that is only recently being addressed, with better data or better ""experiments"".  We conclude with a discussion of the literature that endogenize people's earnings and therefore change the nature of risk faced by households""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Interracial friendships in college,Economic theory,"""Motivated by the reality that the benefits of diversity on a college campus will be mitigated if interracial interactions are scarce or superficial, previous work has strived to document the amount of interracial friendship interaction and to examine whether policy can influence this amount.  In this paper we take advantage of unique longitudinal data from the Berea Panel Study to build on this previous literature by providing direct evidence about the amount of interracial friendships at different stages of college and by providing new evidence about some of the possible underlying reasons for the observed patterns of interaction.  We find that, while much sorting exists at all stages of college, black and white students are, in reality, very compatible as friends; randomly assigned roommates of different races are as likely to become friends as randomly assigned roommates of the same race.  Further, we find that, in the long-run, white students who are randomly assigned black roommates have a significantly larger proportion of black friends than white students who are randomly assigned white roommates, even when the randomly assigned roommates are not included in the calculation of the proportions.  This last result contradicts previous findings in the literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Skills, exports, and the wages of five million Latin American workers",Economic theory,"""The returns to schooling or the skill premium is a key parameter in various literatures, including globalization and inequality and international migration.  This paper explores the skill premium and its link to exports in Latin America, thus linking the skill premium to the emerging literature on the structure of trade and development.  Using data on employment and wages for over five million workers in sixteen Latin American economies, the authors estimate national and industry-specific skill premiums and study some of their determinants.  The evidence suggests that both country and industry characteristics are important in explaining skill premiums.  The analysis also suggests that the incidence of exports within industries, the average income per capita within countries, and the relative abundance of skilled workers are related to the underlying industry and country characteristics that explain skill premiums.  In particular, higher sectoral exports are positively linked with the skill premium at the industry level, a result that supports recent trade models linking exports with wages and the demand for skills""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Give credit where credit is due tracing value added in global production chains /,Economic theory,"""This paper aims to integrate and generalize the many attempts in the literature at tracing value added by country in international trade.  We provide a conceptual framework to estimate value added that is more comprehensive than what is available in the existing literature.  We fully detail the sources of value added accounting for 100 percent of gross exports, including several components of domestic value-added in exports.  The decomposition of value-added exports examines both exports that are absorbed by the direct importer and those that are processed and subsequently exported to other countries.  To empirically implement the framework, we construct an international database of value-added production and trade based on the GTAP database.  Our results document substantial differences between major regional supply networks, with less integration between East and West Europe than within North America or Asia in 2004.  Many measures show that emerging Asia differs considerably from other emerging economies.  Much of Asia, including China itself, sends their exports to countries that provide final assembly on behalf of consumers in other countries.  Asian countries also have relatively dispersed sourcing of imported intermediate inputs""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Choice and competition in local education markets,Economic theory,"""Prompted by widespread concerns about public school quality, a growing empirical literature has measured the effects of greater choice on school performance.  This paper contributes to that literature in three ways.  First, it makes the observation that the overall effect of greater choice, which has been the focus of prior research, can be decomposed into demand and supply components: knowing the relative sizes of the two is very relevant for policy.  Second, using rich data from a large metropolitan area, it provides a direct and intuitive measure of the competition each school faces.  This takes the form of a school-specific elasticity that measures the extent to which reductions in school quality would lead to reductions in demand.  Third, the paper provides evidence that these elasticity measures are strongly related to school performance: a one-standard deviation increase in the competitiveness of a school's local environment within the Bay Area leads to a 0.15 standard deviation increase in average test scores.  This positive correlation is robust and is consistent with strong supply responsiveness on the part of public schools, of relevance to the broader school choice debate""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Real exchange rate volatility and the price of nontradables in sudden-stop-prone economies,Economic theory,"""The dominant view in the empirical literature on exchange rates is that the high variability of real exchange rates is due to movements in exchange-rate-adjusted prices of tradable goods.  This paper shows that this dominant view does not hold in Mexican data for the periods in which the country had managed exchange rate regimes.  Variance analysis of a 30-year sample of monthly data shows that movements in the price of nontradables relative to tradables account for up to 70 percent of the variability of the real exchange rate during these periods.  The paper proposes a model in which this stylized fact, and the Sudden Stops that accompanied the collapse of Mexico's managed exchange rates, could result from an endogenous amplification mechanism operating via nontradables prices in economies with dollarized liabilities and credit constraints.  The key feature of this mechanism is Irving Fisher's debt-deflation process.  Numerical evaluation suggests that the Fisherian deflation effects on consumption, the current account, and relative prices dwarf those induced by the standard balance sheet effect typical of the Sudden Stops literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Brain gain claims about its size and impact on welfare and growth are greatly exaggerated /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Based on static partial equilibrium analysis, the ""new brain drain"" literature argues that, by raising the return to education, a brain drain generates a brain gain that is, under certain conditions, larger than the brain drain itself, and that such a net brain gain results in an increase in welfare and growth due to education's positive externalities. This paper, on the other hand, argues that these claims are exaggerated. In the static case, and based on both partial and general equilibrium considerations, the paper shows that (i) the size of the brain gain is smaller than suggested in that literature; (ii) the impact on welfare and growth is smaller as well (for any brain gain size); (iii) a positive brain gain is likely to result in a smaller human capital gain and may even have a negative impact on the stock of human capital; (iv) an increase in the stock of human capital may have a negative impact on welfare and growth; and (v) in a dynamic framework, the paper shows that the brain drain is unambiguously larger than the brain gain, i.e., that the steady state is characterized by a net brain loss""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Mind the gap unemployment in the new eu regions /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The paper surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on regional unemployment during transition in Central and Eastern Europe. The focus is on Optimal Speed of Transition (OST) models and on comparison of them with the neoclassical tradition. In the typical neoclassical models, spatial differences essentially arise as a consequence of supply side constraints and institutional rigidities. Slow-growth, high-unemployment regions are those with backward economic structures and constraints on factors mobility contribute to making differences persistent. However, such explanations leave the question unanswered of how unemployment differences arise in the first place. Economic transition provides an excellent testing ground to answer this question. Prefiguring an empirical law, the OST literature finds that the high degree of labour turnover of high unemployment regions is associated with a high rate of industrial restructuring and, consequently, that low unemployment may be achieved by implementing transition more gradually. Moreover, international trade, FDI and various agglomeration factors help explain the success of capital cities compared to peripheral towns and rural areas in achieving low unemployment""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
A theory of political cycles,Economic theory,"""The literature on political cycles argues that the proximity of elections affects policy choices. This  literature considers that opportunistic policymakers manipulate policy to increase their reelection probability.  Previous theoretical studies assume that the policymaker can affect his reelection probability only with his last decision before the election. This assumption seems extreme, and directly produces a cycle without presenting a theory of why a policymaker's behavior is different closer to the election.  We shall explain how, without this assumption, existing political-agency models can still produce cycles.  In contrast to previous (theoretical and empirical) studies, we consider how the policymaker's decisions depend on his reputation (the beliefs about his future performance). Since the policymaker's reputation most likely changes over time, in general, one cannot conclude from observing the same behavior throughout the policymaker's term that the proximity of elections does not affect policy choices. Consequently,  our findings suggest reinterpreting previous empirical results and controlling for changes in reputation in future empirical studies. More generally, our results deepen the understanding of agency relationships in which the agent℗s compensation is decided infrequently.""--Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond web site."
The equivalence of wage and price staggering in monetary business cycle models,Finance,"""Chari, Kehoe, and McGratten's (1998) finding that a standard monetary business cycle model with staggered price setting is unable to generate sufficiently persistent real effects of monetary shocks has engendered a growing literature aimed at developing alternative mechanisms for producing greater persistence.  The most popular approach at present in this literature appears to be one in which staggered wage contracts are used as either an alternative or a complement to a staggered price mechanism.  This is informed by recent research by Andersen (1998) and Huang and Liu (1998) which finds that the staggered wage model, despite its superficial similarity to the staggered price setup, incorporates a very different microstructure that implies substantially more real persistence.  This paper argues that these authors' findings rely heavily on the assumption that identical inputs are used by all firms, and demonstrates that, by assuming firm-specific factor inputs the staggered price model is as capable as the staggered wage model of generating persistent real responses to monetary shocks""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Bankruptcy exemptions, credit history, and the mortgage market",Economic theory,"""We develop and test a model of mortgage  underwriting, with particular reference to the role of credit bureau scores.  In  our model scores are used in a standardized fashion, which reflects the  prevalence of automated underwriting in industry practice.  We show that our  model has implications for the debate on the effect of personal bankruptcy  exemptions on secured lending.  Recent literature (Berkowitz and Hynes (1999),  Lin and White (2001)) has developed conflicting theoriesand found  conflicting resultsseeking to explain how exemptions affect the mortgage  market.  By contrast, our model implies that  when lenders use credit scores in a standardized manner, exemptions should be  irrelevant to the mortgage underwriting decision.  Merging data from a major  credit bureau with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset, we confirm  this prediction of our model.  We also show that while ignoring borrower credit  quality may make exemptions appear to be significant, once one controls for  credit scores then exemptions have no effect on the likelihood that a mortgage  application is approved.  We confirm this empirically and argue that this may  help explain some of the results of the previous literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia web site."
New evidence on the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of bond yields,Economic theory,"""This paper tests the expectations hypothesis (EH) with the data used in Campbell and Shiller's (1991) seminal work on the EH using a Lagrange multiplier test developed recently by Bekaert and Hodrick (2001).  This test is applied under the assumption that interest rates are integrated of order one, I(1), as in Campbell and Shiller (1987), and under the assumption that interest rates are stationary.  We also extend the literature beyond the bivariate comparisons of long-term and short-term rates which dominates the EH testing literature.  In addition, we examine the linkage between the term structure and macrcoeconomic variables.  Consistent with the findings of Campbell and Shiller (1991), the EH is rejected at the short end of the maturity spectrum but not at the longer end.  The EH is rejected at the longer end of the term structure when more than two rates or the relationship between the term structure and the macroeconomy are considered.  Moreover, we find that evaluating the EH using the ratio of the variance of the forecasted long-term rate (or rate spread) under the EH to the observed variance generates misleading information about the merit of the EH""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Uncovering the risk-return relation in the stock market,Economic theory,"""There is an ongoing debate in the literature about the apparent weak or negative relation between risk (conditional variance) and return (expected returns) in the aggregate stock market.  We develop and estimate an empirical model based on the ICAPM to investigate this relation.  Our primary innovation is to model and identify empirically the two components of expected returns--the risk component and the component due to the desire to hedge changes in investment opportunities.  We also explicitly model the effect of shocks to expected returns on ex post returns and use implied volatility from traded options to increase estimation efficiency.  As a result, the coefficient of relative risk aversion is estimated more precisely, and we find it to be positive and reasonable in magnitude.  Although volatility risk is priced, as theory dictates, it contributes only a small amount to the time-variation in expected returns.  Expected returns are driven primarily by the desire to hedge changes in investment opportunities.  It is the omission of this hedge component that is responsible for the contradictory and counter-intuitive results in the existing literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Electricity sector reform in developing countries a survey of empirical evidence on determinants and performance /,Finance,"""Driven by ideology, economic reasoning, and early success stories, vast amounts of financial resources and effort have been spent on reforming infrastructure industries in developing countries.  It is therefore important to examine whether evidence supports the logic of reforms.  The authors review the empirical evidence on electricity reform in developing countries.  They find that country institutions and sector governance play an important role in the success and failure of reform.  And reforms also appear to have increased operating efficiency and expanded access to urban customers.  However, the reforms have to a lesser degree passed on efficiency gains to customers, tackled distributional effects, and improved rural access.  Moreover, some of the literature is not methodologically robust and on par with general development economics literature.  Further, findings on some issues are limited and inconclusive, while other important areas are yet to be addressed.  Until we know more, implementation of reforms will be more based on ideology and economic theory rather than solid economic evidence. ""--World Bank web site."
"Skill-biased technological change, earnings of unskilled workers, and crime",Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  This paper investigates the impact of unskilled workers' earnings on crime.  Following the literature on wage inequality and skill-biased technological change, we employ CPS data to create state-year as well as state-year-and (broad) industry specific measures of skill-biased technological change, which are then used as instruments for unskilled workers' earnings in crime regressions.  Regressions that employ state panels reveal that technology-induced variations in unskilled workers' earnings impact property crime with an elasticity of -1, but that wages have no impact on violent crime.  The paper also estimates, for the first time in this literature, structural crime equations using micro panel data from NLSY97 and instrumenting real wages of young workers.  Using state-year-industry specific technology shocks as instruments yields elasticities that are in the neighborhood of -2 for most types of crime, which is markedly larger than previous estimates.  In both data sets there is evidence for asymmetric impact of unskilled workers' earnings on crime.  A decline in earnings has a larger effect on crime in comparison to an increase in earnings by the same absolute value""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trade policy and market power the case of the US steel industry /,Economic theory,"""A primary function of trade policy is to restrict imports to benefit the targeted domestic sector.  However, a well-established theoretical literature highlights that the form of trade policy (e.g., quotas versus tariffs) can have a significant impact on how much trade policy affects firms' abilities to price above marginal cost (i.e., market power).  The US steel industry provides an excellent example to study these issues, as it has received many different types of trade protection over the past decades.  We model the US steel market and then use a panel of data on major steel products from 1980 through 2006 to examine the effects of various trade policies on the steel market.  We find that the US steel market is very competitive throughout our sample with the exception of the period in which they received comprehensive voluntary restraint agreements (i.e., quotas) and were able to price substantially above marginal cost.  All other forms of protection were in tariff form and had little effect on market power, consistent with prior theoretical literature on the nonequivalence of tariffs and quotas.  We also find evidence that market power eroded over time in steel products where mini-mill producers gained sizeable market share, highlighting the role of technology in the market as well""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The forgotten history of domestic debt,Economic theory,"""There is a rich scholarly literature on sovereign default on external debt.  Comparatively little is known about sovereign defaults on domestic debt.  Even today, cross-country data on domestic public debt remains curiously exotic, particularly prior to the 1980s.  We have filled this gap in the literature by compiling a database on central government public debt (external and domestic).  The data span 1914 to 2007 for most countries, reaching back into the nineteenth century for many.  Our findings on debt sustainability, sovereign defaults, the temptation to inflate, and the hierarchy of creditors only scratch the surface of what the domestic public debt data can reveal.  First, domestic debt is big -- for the 64 countries for which we have long time series, domestic debt accounts for almost two-thirds of total public debt.  For most of the sample, this debt carries a market interest rate (except for the financial repression era between WWII and financial liberalization).  Second, the data go a long ways toward explaining the puzzle of why countries so often default on their external debts at seemingly low debt thresholds.  Third, domestic debt has largely been ignored in the vast empirical work on inflation.  In fact, domestic debt (a significant portion of which is long term and non-indexed) is often much larger than the monetary base in the run-up to high inflation episodes.  Last, the widely-held view that domestic residents are strictly junior to external creditors does not find broad support""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

"Water markets in the west prices, trading, and contractual forms /",Economic theory,"""Rising urban and environmental demand for water has created growing pressure to re-allocate water from traditional agricultural uses.  The evolution of water markets has been more complicated than those for other resources.  In this paper, we first explain these differences by examining water rights and regulatory issues.  Second, we place our research in the context of the economics literature on water marketing.  Third, we present new, comprehensive data on prices and the extent, nature, and timing of water transfers across 12 western states from 1987-2005.  We find that prices are higher for agriculture-to-urban trades versus within-agriculture trades, in part, reflecting the differences in marginal values between the two uses.  Prices for urban use are also growing relative to agricultural use.  Markets are responding in that the number of agriculture-to-urban transactions is rising, whereas the number of agriculture-to-agriculture transfers is not.  Further, there is a shift from using short-term leases to using multi-year leases of water and permanent sales of water rights.  This pattern underscores the need to consider the amounts of water obligated over time, rather than examining only annual flows in assessing the quantities of water traded as is the common practice in the literature.  Considering water obligated over time, termed committed water, we find significantly more is transferred and the direction of trading is different than if the focus is on annual flows.  Finally, the data reveal considerable variation in water trading across the states""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
An empirical investigation of labor income processes,Economic theory,"""In this paper we reassess the evidence on labor income risk.  There are two leading views on the nature of the income process in the current literature.  The first view, which we call the ""Restricted Income Profiles"" (RIP) process, holds that individuals are subject to large and very persistent shocks, while facing similar life-cycle income profiles.  The alternative view, which we call the ""Heterogeneous Income Profiles"" (HIP) process, holds that individuals are subject to income shocks with modest persistence, while facing individual-specific income profiles.We first show that ignoring profile heterogeneity, when in fact it is present, introduces an upward bias into the estimates of persistence.  Second, we estimate a parsimonious parameterization of the HIP process that is suitable for calibrating economic models.  The estimated persistence is about 0.8 in the HIP process compared to about 0.99 in the RIP process.  Moreover, the heterogeneity in income profiles is estimated to be substantial, explaining between 56 to 75 percent of income inequality at age 55.  We also find that profile heterogeneity is substantially larger among higher educated individuals.  Third, we discuss the source of identification -- in other words, the aspects of labor income data that allow one to distinguish between the HIP and RIP processes.  Finally, we show that the main evidence against profile heterogeneity in the existing literature -- that the autocorrelations of income changes are small and negative -- is also replicated by the HIP process, suggesting that this evidence may have been misinterpreted""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Remittances and the brain drain,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In most destination countries, immigration policies are increasingly tilted toward the most skilled individuals. Whether this shift hurts economic prospects in sending countries, as argued by the traditional brain drain literature, is somewhat controversial. The most recent literature has focused on the link between skilled out-migration and educational achievements. In this paper, we emphasize a different channel. It is often argued that skilled migrants raise economic welfare at home thanks to a relatively larger flow of remittances. Skilled migrants typically earn relatively more and, ceteris paribus, will therefore remit more. However, they are also likely to spend a longer span of time abroad and also are more likely to reunite with their close family in the host country. Both factors should be associated with a relatively smaller flow of remittances from skilled migrants. Hence, the sign of the impact of the brain drain on total remittances is an empirical question. We first develop a simple model showing that skilled migrants may have indeed a lower propensity to remit home out of a given flow of earnings abroad. We then derive an empirical equation of remittances and estimate it on a large panel of developing countries. As a measure of the brain drain, we use the dataset by Docquier and Marfouk (2004) that in turn builds on the pioneering work of Carrington and Detragiache (2004). We find considerable evidence that the brain drain is associated with a smaller flow of remittances""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Rural-urban migration in developing countries a survey of theoretical predictions and empirical findings /,Finance,"""The migration of labor from rural to urban areas is an important part of the urbanization process in developing countries.  Even though it has been the focus of abundant research over the past five decades, some key policy questions have not found clear answers yet.  To what extent is internal migration a desirable phenomenon and under what circumstances? Should governments intervene and, if so, with what types of interventions? What should be their policy objectives? To shed light on these important issues, the authors survey the existing theoretical models and their conflicting policy implications and discuss the policies that may be justified based on recent relevant empirical studies.  A key limitation is that much of the empirical literature does not provide structural tests of the theoretical models, but only provides partial findings that can support or invalidate intuitions and in that sense, support or invalidate the policy implications of the models.  The authors' broad assessment of the literature is that migration can be beneficial or at least be turned into a beneficial phenomenon so that in general migration restrictions are not desirable.  They also identify some data issues and research topics which merit further investigation. ""--World Bank web site."
Are leading indicators of financial crises useful for assessing country vulnerability? evidence from the 2008-09 global crisis /,Economic theory,"""This paper investigates whether leading indicators can help explain the cross-country incidence of the 2008-09 financial crisis.  Rather than looking for indicators with specific relevance to the current crisis, the selection of variables is driven by an extensive review of more than eighty papers from the previous literature on early warning indicators.  The review suggests that central bank reserves and past movements in the real exchange rate are the two leading indicators that have proven the most useful in explaining crisis incidence across different countries and crises in the past.  For the 2008-09 crisis, we use six different variables to measure crisis incidence: drops in GDP and industrial production, currency depreciation, stock market performance, reserve losses, or participation in an IMF program.  We find that the level of reserves in 2007 appears as a consistent and statistically significant leading indicator of the current crisis, in line with the conclusions of the earlier literature.  In addition to reserves, recent real appreciation is a statistically significant predictor of devaluation and of a measure of exchange market pressure during the current crisis.  That our data on the crisis period include the first quarter of 2009 may explain why we find stronger results than earlier papers such as Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2009, 2010) and Rose and Spiegel (2009a,b)""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The economics of international differences in educational achievement,Economic theory,"""An emerging economic literature over the past decade has made use of international tests of educational achievement to analyze the determinants and impacts of cognitive skills.  The cross-country comparative approach provides a number of unique advantages over national studies: It can exploit institutional variation that does not exist within countries; draw on much larger variation than usually available within any country; reveal whether any result is country-specific or more general; test whether effects are systematically heterogeneous in different settings; circumvent selection issues that plague within-country identification by using system-level aggregated measures; and uncover general-equilibrium effects that often elude studies in a single country.  The advantages come at the price of concerns about the limited number of country observations, the mostly cross-sectional character of available achievement data, and possible bias from unobserved country factors such as culture.  This chapter reviews the economic literature on international differences in educational achievement, restricting itself to comparative analyses that are not possible within single countries and placing particular emphasis on studies trying to address key issues of empirical identification.  While quantitative input measures show little impact, several measures of institutional structures and of the quality of the teaching force can account for significant portions of the immense international differences in the level and equity of student achievement.  Variations in skills measured by the international achievement tests are in turn strongly related to individual labor-market outcomes and, perhaps more importantly, to cross-country variations in economic growth""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Sri Lanka's migrant labor remittances enhancing the quality and outreach of the rural remittance infrastructure /,Finance,"""Remittances-money sent home by immigrant workers abroad-are hugely beneficial to Sri Lanka.  Migrants' remittances have grown dramatically in recent years and are now estimated at US$1.5 billion annually.  This national phenomenon is consistent with remittance trends in neighboring countries where remittance flows are growing as rapidly.  The trend is likely to continue as many workers continue to look abroad for the chance to make a better living.  The economic policy implications of these trends are significant.  The Sri Lankan Central Bank is now debating the following key issues: the developmental impact of remittances; the high transaction costs associated with remittances; and the level of transparency and accountability in the remittance industry, especially the informal remittance sector.  This paper highlights the key policy issues associated with each of these aspects of remittances with the objective of improving the public and private infrastructure for current and future flows.  Building on recent World Bank research on remittances that prominently features South Asia, it has been prepared in recognition of the development potential of these flows.  It discusses some of the key issues relating to the remittance industry in Sri Lanka.  This paper complements the existing literature on migrant labor remittances to Sri Lanka and extends that literature by providing specific policy-relevant guidance on short and long-term policies for enhance enhancing the quality and outreach of rural remittance infrastructure.

Analyzing urban poverty a summary of methods and approaches /,Finance,"""In recent years an extensive body of literature has emerged on the definition, measurement, and analysis of poverty.  Much of this literature focuses on analyzing poverty at the national level, or spatial disaggregation by general categories of urban or rural areas, with adjustments made for regional price differentials.  Yet for an individual city attempting to tackle the problems of urban poverty, this level of aggregation is not sufficient for answering specific questions such as where the poor are located in the city, whether there are differences between poor areas, if access to services varies by subgroup, whether specific programs are reaching the poorest, and how to design effective poverty reduction programs and policies.  Answering these questions is critical, particularly for large, sprawling cities with highly diverse populations and growing problems of urban poverty.  Understanding urban poverty presents a set of issues distinct from general poverty analysis and thus may require additional tools and techniques.  Baker and Schuler summarize the main issues in conducting urban poverty analysis, with a focus on presenting a sample of case studies from urban areas that were implemented by a number of different agencies using a range of analytical approaches for studying urban poverty.  Specific conclusions regarding design and analysis, data, timing, cost, and implementation issues are discussed.

"Reallocation, firm turnover, and efficiency selection on productivity or profitability /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""There is considerable evidence that producer-level churning contributes substantially to aggregate (industry) productivity growth, as more productive businesses displace less productive ones. However, this research has been limited by the fact that producer-level prices are typically unobserved; thus within-industry price differences are embodied in productivity measures. If prices reflect idiosyncratic demand or market power shifts, high ""productivity"" businesses may not be particularly efficient, and the literature's findings might be better interpreted as evidence of entering businesses displacing less profitable, but not necessarily less productive, exiting businesses. In this paper, we investigate the nature of selection and productivity growth using data from industries where we observe producer-level quantities and prices separately. We show there are important differences between revenue and physical productivity. A key dissimilarity is that physical productivity is inversely correlated with plant-level prices while revenue productivity is positively correlated with prices. This implies that previous work linking (revenue-based) productivity to survival has confounded the separate and opposing effects of technical efficiency and demand on survival, understating the true impacts of both. We further show that young producers charge lower prices than incumbents, and as such the literature understates the productivity advantage of new producers and the contribution of entry to aggregate productivity growth""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Local economic structure and growth,Finance,"""The author tests how the local economic structure-measured by a region's sector specialization, competition, and diversity-affects the technological growth of manufacturing sectors.  Most of the empirical literature on this topic assumes that in the long run more productive regions will attract more workers and use employment growth as a measure of local productivity growth.  However, this approach is based on strong assumptions about national labor markets.  The author shows that when these assumptions are relaxed, regional adjusted wage growth is a better measure of regional productivity growth than employment growth.  She compares the two measures using data for Portugal between 1985 and 1994.  With the regional adjusted wage growth, the author finds evidence of Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) externalities in some sectors and no evidence of Jacobs or Porter externalities in most of the manufacturing sectors.  These results are at odds with her findings for employment-based regressions, which show that concentration and region size have a negative and significant effect in most of the manufacturing sectors.  These employment-based results are in line with most of the existing literature, which suggests that using employment growth to proxy for productivity growth leads to misleading results.

Why governments should stop non-social subsidies measuring their consequences for rural Latin America /,Finance,"""The provision of public goods and the amelioration of market failure are the classical justifications for government intervention in the economy.  In reality, (1) governments intervene in markets that are not affected by failure, and (2) a large share of the government resources is spent in private goods, not in public goods.  In contrast to issue 1, issue 2 has received little attention in the literature, in spite of the potentially large efficiency and equity losses arising from misguided allocations of public expenditures.  López empirically documents the size of (2) in the rural sector and investigates its consequences for rural development for 10 Latin American countries over the 1985-2000 period.  The econometric evidence suggests that the structure of public expenditures is an important factor of economic development in the rural sector, much greater than that of the level of public expenditures and of other factors on which the development literature has traditionally focused.  Expanding total public expenditure in rural areas while maintaining the existing public expenditure composition prevailing in certain countries does little to promote agricultural income and reduce rural poverty.  Spending a significant share of government resources in (non-social) subsidies causes less agriculture income, induces an excessive reliance of agriculture on land expansion, and reduces the income of the rural poor.

The more the merrier? the effect of family composition on children's education /,Economic theory,"""Among the perceived inputs in the production' of child quality is family size; there is an extensive theoretical literature that postulates a tradeoff between child quantity and quality within a family.  However, there is little causal evidence that speaks to this theory.  Our analysis is able to overcome many limitations of the previous literature by using a rich dataset that contains information on the entire population of Norway over an extended period of time and allows us to match adult children to their parents and siblings.  In addition, we use exogenous variation in family size induced by the birth of twins to isolate causation.  Like most previous studies, we find a negative correlation between family size and children's educational attainment.  However, when we include indicators for birth order, the effect of family size becomes negligible.  This finding is robust to the use of twin births as an instrument for family size.  In addition, we find that birth order has a significant and large effect on children's education; children born later in the family obtain less education.

Technology adoption from hybrid corn to beta blockers,Economic theory,"""In his classic 1957 study of hybrid corn, Griliches emphasized the importance of economic incentives and profitability in the adoption of new technology, and this focus has been continued in the economics literature.  But there is a distinct literature with roots in sociology emphasizing the structure of organizations, informal networks, and ""change agents."" We return to a forty-year-old debate between Griliches and the sociologists by considering state-level factors associated with the adoption of a variety of technological innovations: hybrid corn and tractors in the first half of the 20th century, computers in the 1990s, and the treatment of heart attacks during the last decade.  First, we find that some states consistently adopted new effective technology, whether hybrid corn, tractors, or effective treatments for heart attacks such as Beta Blockers.  Second, the adoption of these new highly effective technologies was closely associated with social capital and state-level 1928 high school graduation rates, but not per capita income, density, or (in the case of Beta Blockers) expenditures on heart attack patients.  Economic models are useful in identifying why some regions are more likely to adopt early, but sociological barriers -- perhaps related to a lack of social capital or informational networks -- can potentially explain why other regions lag far behind""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

"Preschool, day care, and afterschool care who's minding the kids? /",Economic theory,"""The majority of children in the U.S. and many other high-income nations are now cared for many hours per week by people who are neither their parents nor their school teachers.  The role of such preschool and out of school care is potentially two-fold: First, child care makes it feasible for parents to be employed.  Second, early intervention programs and after school programs aim to enhance child development, particularly among disadvantaged children.  Corresponding to this distinction, the literature has two branches.  The first focuses on the market for child care and analyzes factors affecting the supply, demand, and quality of care.  The second focuses on child outcomes and asks whether certain types of programs can ameliorate the effects of early disadvantage.  The primary goal of this review is to bring the two literatures together in order to suggest ways that both may be enhanced.  Accordingly, we provide an overview of the number of children being cared for in different sorts of arrangements; describe theory and evidence about the nature of the private child care market; and discuss theory and evidence about government intervention in the market for child care.  Our summary suggests that additional research is necessary to highlight the ways that government programs and market provided child care interact with each other""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Endogenous skill bias in technology adoption city-level evidence from the it revolution,Economic theory,"""This paper focuses on the bi-directional interaction between technology adoption and labor market conditions.

Our approach melds the literature on the effect of the relative supply of skilled labor on technology adoption to the often distinct literature on how technological change influences the relative demand for skilled labor.  Our results support the idea that differences in technology use across cities and its effects on wages reflect an equilibrium response to local factor supply conditions.  The model and data suggest that cities initially endowed with relatively abundant and cheap skilled labor adopted PCs more aggressively than cities with relatively expensive skilled labor, causing returns to skill to increase most in cities that adopted PCs most intensively.

Is new economic geography right? evidence from price data /,Economic theory,"""The agglomeration force behind the New Economic Geography literature initiated by Krugman is based on the notion that larger markets should have a lower variety adjusted price index.  Despite his Nobel Prize, there have been no tests of this idea.  This paper represents the first such test.  Using a rich dataset covering 10-20 million purchases of grocery items, we find that after controlling for store and shopping effects: 1) Aggregate grocery prices are lower in larger cities; 2) Residents of larger cities have access to substantially more varieties than residents of smaller cities; and 3) These forces combine to substantially lower variety adjusted prices in large cities.  In short, Krugman was right""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
What do consumers believe about future gasoline prices?,Economic theory,"""An NBER digest for this paper is available.Researchers estimating the demand for energy-using durable goods must specify consumers' beliefs about future energy prices.  Policy-relevant inference hinges on this specification, yet there is little direct evidence on the nature of consumer beliefs.  We provide such evidence by analyzing two decades of data on gasoline price expectations from the Michigan Survey of Consumers.  We find that average consumer beliefs are indistinguishable from a no-change forecast.  This finding has important implications for the literature on consumer valuation of energy efficiency, and it implies that researchers are likely justified in assuming a no-change forecast, as is common practice""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Are Engel curve estimates of CPI bias biased?,Economic theory,"""A recent literature has advanced the use of Engel curves to estimate overall CPI bias.  In this paper, I show that the methodology is sensitive to the modeling of household demography.  Existing estimates of CPI bias do not account for the changing effect of household size on budget shares, and this can lead to omitted variable bias.  Since the effect of household size on demand changes over time the drift in Engel curves attributed to CPI bias is partially explained by this effect.  My estimates of the annual rate of CPI bias from 1888 to 1935 are changed by at least 25%, and usually more than 50%, once the changing effect of household size is accounted for""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
High frequency market microstructure noise estimates and liquidity measures,Economic theory,"""Using recent advances in the econometrics literature, we disentangle from high frequency observations on the transaction prices of a large sample of NYSE stocks a fundamental component and a microstructure noise component.  We then relate these statistical measurements of market microstructure noise to observable characteristics of the underlying stocks, and in particular to different financial measures of their liquidity.  We find that more liquid stocks based on financial characteristics have lower noise and noise-to-signal ratio measured from their high frequency returns.  We then examine whether there exists a common, market-wide, factor in high frequency stock-level measurements of noise, and whether that factor is priced in asset returns""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Testing for adverse selection in insurance markets,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews and evaluates the empirical literature on adverse selection in insurance markets.  We focus on empirical work that seeks to test the basic coverage-risk prediction of adverse selection theory-that is, that policyholders who purchase more insurance coverage tend to be riskier.  The analysis of this body of work, we argue, indicates that whether such a correlation exists varies across insurance markets and pools of insurance policies.  We discuss various reasons why a coverage-risk correlation may be found in some pools of insurance policies but not in others.  We also review the work on the disentangling of adverse selection and moral hazard and on learning by policyholders and insurers""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Direct and indirect effects of teenage body weight on adult wages,Economic theory,"""Previous estimates on the association between body weight and wages in the literature have been contingent on education and occupation.  This paper examines the direct effect of BMI on wages and the indirect effects operating through education and occupation choice, particularly for late-teen BMI and adult wages.  Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data, we show that education is the main pathway for the indirect BMI wage penalty.  The total BMI wage penalty is underestimated by 18% for women without including those indirect effects.  Whereas for men there is no statistically significant direct BMI wage penalty, we do observe a small indirect wage penalty through education""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Altruism, fertility, and the value of children health policy evaluation and intergenerational welfare /",Economic theory,"""This paper accounts for the value of children and future generations in the evaluation of health policies.  This is achieved through the incorporation of altruism and fertility in ""value of life"" type of framework.  We are able to express adults' willingness to pay for changes in child mortality and also to incorporate the welfare of future generations in the evaluation of current policies.  Our model clarifies a series of puzzles from the literature on the ""value of life"" and on intergenerational welfare comparisons.  We show that, by incorporating altruism and fertility into the analysis, the estimated welfare gain from recent reductions in mortality in the U.S.  easily doubles""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Optimal response to a transitory demographic shock in social security financing,Economic theory,"""We examine the optimal policy response to a transitory demographic shock that affects negatively the financing of retirement pensions.  In contrast to existing literature, we endogenously determine optimal policies rather than exploring implications of exogenous parametric policies.  Our approach identifies optimal strategies of the social security administration to guarantee the financial sustainability of existing retirement pensions in a Pareto improving way.  Hence, no cohort will pay the cost of the demographic shock.  We find that the optimal strategy is based in the following ingredients: elimination of compulsory retirement, a change in the structure of labor income taxation and a temporary increase in the level of government debt""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Pinning down the value of statistical life,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Our research addresses fundamental long-standing concerns in the compensating wage differentials literature and its public policy implications: the econometric properties of estimates of the value of statistical life (VSL) and the wide range of such estimates from about $0.5 million to about $21 million. We address most of the prominent econometric issues by applying panel data, a new and more accurate fatality risk measure, and systematic selection of panel estimator in our research. Controlling for measurement error, endogeneity, individual heterogeneity, and state dependence yields both a reasonable average level and narrow range for the estimated value of a statistical life of about $5.5--$7.5 million""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Strategic online-banking adoption,Economic theory,"""In this paper we study the determinants of the decision of U.S.  banks to create a transactional website for their customers.  We show that although bank-specific characteristics (such as the volume of deposits) are important, competition plays a prominent role.  In more competitive markets banks are more likely to adopt earlier.  Even more important, banks adopt earlier in markets where their competitors have already adopted.  A contribution of this paper is to study the adoption decision over time using a panel of commercial banks.  We also contribute to the literature by adapting a measure of competition related to the choices of competitors that a bank faces in each market""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Can news about the future drive the business cycle?,Economic theory,"""We propose a model that generates an economic expansion in response to good news about future total factor productivity (TFP) or investment-specific technical change.  The model has three key elements: variable capital utilization, adjustment costs to investment, and preferences that exhibit a weak short-run wealth effect on the labor supply.  These preferences nest the two classes of utility functions most widely used in the business cycle literature as special cases.  Our model can generate recessions that resemble those of the post-war U.S.  economy without relying on negative productivity shocks.  The recessions are caused not by contemporaneous negative shocks but rather by lackluster news about future TFP or investment-specific technical change""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"A gain from trade more research, less obstruction /",Economic theory,"""There is an old wisdom that reductions in tariffs force changes on producers that lead to costless, or nearly so, increases in productivity. We construct a technology-ladder model that captures this wisdom. As in other technology-ladder models, time spent in research helps propel an industry up a technology-ladder. In contrast to the literature, we include another activity that plays a role in determining an industry's position on the technology-ladder: attempts to obstruct the research program of rivals (through regulations, for example). In this world, reductions in tariffs between countries lead producers to spend more time in research and less in obstruction of rivals""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
"Great expectations law, employment contracts, and labor market performance /",Economic theory,"""This paper reviews the literature on employment and labor law.  It is observed that all jurisdictions in the world have extensive employment and labor law, even though many economists recommend a reduction in legal restrictions.  The review of the law illustrates that it has evolved in response to problems of market and contract incompleteness, that often leads to inefficient allocations ex post.  In contrast, due to data limitations, the economic analysis of legal rules tends to focus upon ex post inefficiencies.  The review concludes that in order to understand the structure of current legal rules, and the appropriate way to modify them there needs to be more empirical research that explicitly incorporates transactions costs""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Estimating marginal returns to education,Economic theory,"""This paper estimates the marginal returns to college for individuals induced to enroll in college by different marginal policy changes.  The recent instrumental variables literature seeks to estimate this parameter, but in general it does so only under strong assumptions that are tested and found wanting.  We show how to utilize economic theory and local instrumental variables estimators to estimate the effect of marginal policy changes.  Our empirical analysis shows that returns are higher for individuals with values of unobservables that make them more likely to attend college.  We contrast the returns to well-defined marginal policy changes with IV estimates of the return to schooling.  Some marginal policy changes inducing students into college produce very low returns""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Six distributional effects of environmental policy,Economic theory,"""While prior literature has identified various effects of environmental policy, this note uses the example of a proposed carbon permit system to illustrate and discuss six different types of distributional effects: (1) higher prices of carbon-intensive products, (2) changes in relative returns to factors like labor, capital, and resources, (3) allocation of scarcity rents from a restricted number of permits, (4) distribution of the benefits from improvements in environmental quality, (5) temporary effects during the transition, and (6) capitalization of all those effects into prices of land, corporate stock, or house values.  The note also discusses whether all six effects could be regressive, that is, whether carbon policy could place disproportionate burden on the poor""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Delegation of authority as an optimal (in)complete contract,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The present paper aims to contribute to the literature on the foundations of incomplete contracts by providing conditions under which simple delegation of authority is the solution to the complete-contracting problem of the parties. We consider a hold-up framework where both parties profit from an investment that raises the value of an asset. Delegation turns out to be optimal if (i) the decision-dependent parts of the payoffs of the parties are linear in the asset value, and (ii) decisions have no investment-independent effect. If overinvestment might be an issue, delegation, however, with restricted competencies is optimal if some additional continuity requirements are met""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Solving models with external habit,Economic theory,"""Habit utility has been the focus of a large and growing body of literature in financial economics.  This study investigates ways of accurately and efficiently solving the Campbell and Cochrane (1999) external habit model.  Solutions for this model based on a grid of values for the state variable are shown to converge as the grid becomes increasingly fine.  Convergence is substantially faster if the price-dividend ratio is computed as a series of 'zero-coupon equity' claims rather than as the fixed-point of the Euler equation.  Fitting the model to the term structure as well as to equity moments (as in Wachter (2005)) also results in faster convergence""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Do institutions cause growth?,Economic theory,"""We revisit the debate over whether political institutions cause economic growth, or whether, alternatively, growth and human capital accumulation lead to institutional improvement.  We find that most indicators of institutional quality used to establish the proposition that institutions cause growth are constructed to be conceptually unsuitable for that purpose.  We also find that some of the instrumental variable techniques used in the literature are flawed.  Basic OLS results, as well as a variety of additional evidence, suggest that a) human capital is a more basic source of growth than are the institutions, b) poor countries get out of poverty through good policies, often pursued by dictators, and c) subsequently improve their political institutions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Urban growth and housing supply,Economic theory,"""Cities are physical structures, but the modern literature on urban economic development rarely acknowledges that fact.  The elasticity of housing supply helps determine the extent to which increases in productivity will create bigger cities or just higher paid workers and more expensive homes.  In this paper, we present a simple model that provides a framework for doing empirical work that integrates the heterogeneity of housing supply into urban development.  Empirical analysis yields results consistent with the implications of the model that differences in the nature of house supply across space are not only responsible for higher housing prices, but also affect how cities respond to increases in productivity""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Innovation and diffusion,Economic theory,"""The contribution made by innovation and new technologies to economic growth and welfare is largely determined by the rate and manner by which innovations diffuse throughout the relevant population, but this topic has been a somewhat neglected one in the economics of innovation.  This chapter, written for a handbook on innovation, provides a historical and comparative perspective on diffusion that looks at the broad determinants of diffusion, economic, social, and institutional, viewed from a microeconomic perspective.  A framework for thinking about these determinants is presented along with a brief nontechnical review of modeling strategies used in different social scientific literatures.  It concludes with a discussion of gaps in our understanding and potential future research questions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"The real exchange rate, real interest rates, and the risk premium",Economic theory,"""The well-known uncovered interest parity puzzle arises from the empirical regularity that, among developed country pairs, the high interest rate country tends to have high expected returns on its short term assets.  At the same time, another strand of the literature has documented that high real interest rate countries tend to have currencies that are strong in real terms - indeed, stronger than can be accounted for by the path of expected real interest differentials under uncovered interest parity.  These two strands - one concerning short-run expected changes and the other concerning the level of the real exchange rate - have apparently contradictory implications for the relationship of the foreign exchange risk premium and interest-rate differentials.  This paper documents the puzzle, and shows that existing models appear unable to account for both empirical findings.  The features of a model that might reconcile the findings are discussed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Sovereigns, upstream capital flows and global imbalances",Economic theory,"""We decompose capital flows - both debt and equity - into public and private components and study their relationship with productivity growth.  This exercise reveals that international capital flows are mainly shaped by government decisions and sovereign to sovereign transactions.  Specifically, we show: (i) international capital flows net of government debt are positively correlated with growth and allocated according to the neoclassical predictions; (ii) international capital flows net of official aid flows, which are mostly accounted as debt, are also positively correlated with productivity growth consistent with the predictions of the neoclassical model; (iii) public debt flows are negatively correlated with growth only if government debt is financed by another sovereign and not by private lenders.  Our results show that the failure to consider official flows as the main driver of uphill flows and global imbalances is an important shortcoming of the recent literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Identification and inference with many invalid instruments,Economic theory,"""We analyze linear models with a single endogenous regressor in the presence of many instrumental variables.  We weaken a key assumption typically made in this literature by allowing all the instruments to have direct effects on the outcome.  We consider restrictions on these direct effects that allow for point identification of the effect of interest.  The setup leads to new insights concerning the properties of conventional estimators, novel identification strategies, and new estimators to exploit those strategies.  A key assumption underlying the main identification strategy is that the product of the direct effects of the instruments on the outcome and the effects of the instruments on the endogenous regressor has expectation zero.  We argue in the context of two specific examples with a group structure that this assumption has substantive content""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Persistent liquidity effects and long run money demand,Economic theory,"""We present a monetary model in the presence of segmented asset markets that implies a persistent fall in interest rates after a once and for all increase in liquidity.  The gradual propagation mechanism produced by our model is novel in the literature.  We provide an analytical characterization of this mechanism, showing that the magnitude of the liquidity effect on impact, and its persistence, depend on the ratio of two parameters: the long-run interest rate elasticity of money demand and the intertemporal substitution elasticity.  At the same time, the model has completely classical long-run predictions, featuring quantity theoretic and Fisherian properties.  The model simultaneously explains the short-run ""instability"" of money demand estimates as-well-as the stability of long-run interest-elastic money demand""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Schooling supply and the structure of production evidence from US states 1950-1990 /,Economic theory,"""We find that over the period 1950-1990, US states absorbed increases in the supply of schooling due to tighter compulsory schooling and child labor laws mostly through within-industry increases in the schooling intensity of production.  Shifts in the industry composition towards more schooling-intensive industries played a less important role.  To try and understand this finding theoretically, we consider a free trade model with two goods/industries, two skill types, and many regions that produce a fixed range of differentiated varieties of the same goods.  We find that a calibrated version of the model can account for shifts in schooling supply being mostly absorbed through within-industry increases in the schooling intensity of production even if the elasticity of substitution between varieties is substantially higher than estimates in the literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Health care financing, efficiency, and equity",Economic theory,"""This paper examines the efficiency and equity implications of alternative health care system financing strategies.  Using data across the OECD, I find that almost all financing choices are compatible with efficiency in the delivery of health care, and that there has been no consistent and systematic relationship between financing and cost containment.  Using data on expenditures and life expectancy by income quintile from the Canadian health care system, I find that universal, publicly-funded health insurance is modestly redistributive.  Putting $1 of tax funds into the public health insurance system effectively channels between $0.23 and $0.26 toward the lowest income quintile people, and about $0.50 to the bottom two income quintiles.  Finally, a review of the literature across the OECD suggests that the progressivity of financing of the health insurance system has limited implications for overall income inequality, particularly over time""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Healthy, wealthy, and wise socioeconomic status, poor health in childhood, and human capital development /",Economic theory,"""There are many possible pathways between parental education, income, and health, and between child health and education, but only some of them have been explored in the literature.  This essay focuses on links between parental socioeconomic status (as measured by education, income, occupation, or in some cases area of residence) and child health, and between child health and adult education or income.  Specifically, I ask two questions: What is the evidence regarding whether parental socioeconomic status affects child health? And, what is the evidence relating child health to future educational and labor market outcomes? I show that there is now strong evidence of both links, suggesting that health could play a role in the intergenerational transmission of economic status""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Managing public investment funds best practices and new challenges /,Economic theory,"""Publicly-held pools of assets have grown dramatically over the last several years, and they are playing an increasingly prominent role in cross-national investments.  This paper examines how to better secure prudent and economically sound public fund management practices, focusing on ways to formulate and build a strong governance structure for managing the assets, how one might protect the assets from political interference, and what sensible investment policy might entail.  We compare three distinct forms of public funds, namely foreign exchange reserve funds, sovereign wealth funds, and public pension funds, to highlight similarities and differences between these.  We also explore how their management structure relates to governance practices and country-specific characteristics, drawing from the pension and corporate finance literature.  Last, we discuss alternative means of managing public reserve funds in aging economies such as Japan, to help meet future social security liabilities in the face of rapid demographic aging""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Economics and ideology causal evidence of the impact of economic conditions on support for redistribution and other ballot proposals /,Economic theory,"""There is a large literature demonstrating that positive economic conditions increase support for incumbent candidates, but little understanding of how economic conditions affect preferences for parties and for particulars of their platforms.  We ask how exogenous shifts to the value of residents' human capital affect voting behavior in California neighborhoods.  As predicted by economic theory, we find that positive economic shocks decrease support for redistributive policies.  More notably, we find that conservative voting on a wide variety of ballot propositions -- from crime to gambling to campaign finance -- is increasing in economic well being.  We further show that positive economic circumstances decrease turnout and have a mixed impact on candidate choice, highlighting a limitation of inferring policy preferences from party choice""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Measuring the risk-adjusted performance of us buyouts,Economic theory,"""This paper measures the risk-adjusted performance of US buyouts.  It draws on a unique and proprietary set of data on 133 US buyouts between 1984 and 2004.  For each of them we determine a public market equivalent that matches it with respect to its timing and its systematic risk.  After a correction for selection bias in our data, the regression of the buyout internal rates of return on the internal rates of return of the mimicking portfolio yields a positive and statistically significant alpha.  Our sensitivity analyses highlight the necessity of a comprehensive risk-adjustment that considers both operating risk and leverage risk for an accurate assessment of buyout performance.  This finding is particularly important as existing literature on that topic tends to rely on performance measures without a proper risk-adjustment""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Procrastination and impatience,Economic theory,"""There is a large body of literature documenting both a preference for immediacy and a tendency to procrastinate.  O'Donoghue and Rabin (1999a,b, 2001) and Choi et al.  (2005) model these behaviors as the two faces of the same phenomenon.  In this paper, we use a combination of lab, field, and survey evidence to study whether these two types of behavior are indeed linked.  To measure immediacy we had subjects choose between a series of smaller-sooner and larger-later rewards.  Both rewards were paid with a check in order to control for transaction costs.  To measure procrastination we use the subjects' actual behavior in cashing the check and completing tasks on time.  Our results lend support to the hypothesis that subjects who have a preference for immediacy are indeed more likely to procrastinate""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The dynamics of city formation,Economic theory,"""This paper examines city formation in a country whose urban population is growing steadily over time, with new cities required to accommodate this growth.  In contrast to most of the literature there is immobility of housing and urban infrastructure, and investment in these assets is taken on the basis of forward-looking behavior.  In the presence of these fixed assets cities form sequentially, without the population swings in existing cities that arise in current models, but with swings in house rents.  Equilibrium city size, absent government, may be larger or smaller than is efficient, depending on how urban externalities vary with population.  Efficient formation of cities with internalization of externalities involves local government intervention and borrowing to finance development.  The paper explores the institutions required for successful local government intervention""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
What do economists know about crime?,Economic theory,"""In this paper we evaluate what economists have learned over the past 40 years about the determinants of crime.  We base our evaluation on two kinds of evidence: an examination of aggregate data over long time periods and across countries, and a critical review of the literature.  We argue that economists know little about the empirically relevant determinants of crime.  Even hypotheses that find some support in U.S.  data for recent decades are inconsistent with data over longer horizons or across countries.  This conclusion applies both to policy variables like arrest rates or capital punishment and to less conventional factors such as abortion or gun laws.  The hypothesis that drug prohibition generates violence, however, is generally consistent with the long times-series and cross-country facts.  This analysis is also consistent with a broader perspective in which government policies that affect the nature and amount of dispute resolution play an important role in determining violence""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Climate economics a meta-review and some suggestions /,Economic theory,"""What have we learned from the outpouring of literature as a result of the Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change? A lot.  We have explored the model space and the parameter space much more thoroughly, though there are still unexplored regions.  While there are aspects of the Stern Review's analysis with which we can disagree, it seems fair to say that it has catalyzed a fundamental rethinking of the economic case for action on climate change.  We are now in a position to give some conditions that are sufficient to provide a case for strong action on climate change, but need more work before we have a fully satisfactory account of the relevant economics.  In particular we need to understand better how climate change affects natural capital - the natural environment and the ecosystems comprising it - and how these affect human welfare""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Zooming in from aggregate volatility to income distribution /,Finance,"""In contrast with a growing literature on the drivers of aggregate volatility in developing countries, its consequences in terms of individual incomes have received less attention.  This paper looks at the impact of cyclical output fluctuations and extreme output events (crises) on unemployment, poverty, and inequality.  The authors find robust evidence that aggregate volatility has a regressive, asymmetric, and non linear impact, as reflected in the strong influence of extreme output drops.  The findings show that, in addition to the mitigating role of personal wealth, public expenditure and labor protection exert a similar benign effect.

The demographic and socio-economic distribution of excess mortality during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,Finance,"""There is an extensive literature on violent conflicts such as the 1994 Rwandan genocide, but few papers examine the profiles of victims and perpetrators, or more broadly the micro-level dynamics of widespread violence.  This paper studies the demographic consequences of the Rwandan genocide and how the excess mortality due to the conflict was distributed in the population.  Data collected by the 2000 Demographic and Health Survey indicate that although there were more deaths across the entire population, adult males were the most likely to die.  Using the characteristics of the survey respondent as a proxy for the socio-economic status of the family dead, the results also show that individuals with an urban or more educated background were more likely to die.  Over and above the human tragedies, a long-term cost of the genocide is the country's loss of productive skills. ""--World Bank web site."
Valuing mortality and morbidity in the context of disaster risks,Finance,"""Benefit-cost analyses of disaster risk reduction (DRR) projects are an important tool for evaluating the efficiency of such projects, and an important input into decision making.  These analyses, however, often fail to monetize the benefits of reduced death and injury.  The authors review the literature on valuing reduced death and injury, and suggest methods for calculating order-of-magnitude estimates of these benefits.  Because few empirical estimates of the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) are available for developing countries, methods for transferring estimates from high income to middle and low income countries are reviewed.  The authors suggest using the range of values implied by an income elasticity of 1.0 and an elasticity of 1.5.  With regard to injury valuation they discuss arguments for and against monetizing Quality Adjusted Life Years, and provide shortcuts to valuing injuries that may be used to assess their importance in DRR benefit-cost analyses.

Grand corruption in utilities,Finance,"""This paper discusses mechanisms of grand corruption in private sector utility provision in developing countries.  By the term ""grand corruption,"" the authors abstract from the petty corruption that consumers experience - for example, when firms and individuals pay bribes to get water delivery or an electricity connection.  The paper focuses on decisions made at the government level involving private sector management, ownership, and provision of utility services.  Corruption at that level may influence the pace and nature of private sector involvement and competition in utilities, as well as the level and form of investments, subsidies, and prices.  On the basis of a literature review and interviews with firms and regulating authorities in two countries, Tanzania and the Philippines, this paper discusses the levels and determinants of grand corruption in utilities.  The paper concludes by discussing a research program to extend this knowledge through a cross-country survey instrument. ""--World Bank web site."
Taxation and capital structure evidence from a transition economy /,Finance,"""The authors examine the effects of taxation on financing policy using the corporate tax reform in 2001 in Croatia as a natural experiment.  Since the extant literature on tax effects on capital structure studies listed firms in developed countries, it is worth investigating whether the same results apply to privately-held, small and medium size firms in transition economies.  The findings provide significant evidence that lower taxes have affected the capital structure of Croatian firms, resulting in increased equity levels and decreased long-term debt levels.  The authors also find that smaller and more profitable firms were more likely to reduce their debt levels.  These findings are consistent with the trade-off theory of capital structure, which suggests that lower taxes decrease the incentive to hold debt due to decreasing interest tax deductibility.

Environmental liability and redevelopment of old industrial land,Economic theory,"""Many communities are concerned about the reuse of potentially contaminated land (""brownfields"") and believe that environmental liability is a hindrance to redevelopment.  However, with land price adjustments, liability might not impede the reuse of this land.  Existing literature has found price reductions in response to liability, but few studies have looked for an effect on vacancies.  This paper studies variations in state liability rules -- specifically, strict liability and joint and several liability -- that affect the level and distribution of expected private cleanup costs.  It explores the effects of this variation on industrial land prices and vacancy rates and on reported brownfields in a panel of cities across the United States.  In the estimated equations, joint and several liability reduces land prices and increases vacancy rates in central cities.  Neither a price nor quantity effect is estimated from strict liability.  The results suggest that liability is at least partly capitalized, but does still deter redevelopment""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The elasticity of taxable income with respect to marginal tax rates a critical review /,Economic theory,"""This paper critically surveys the large and growing literature estimating the elasticity of taxable income with respect to marginal tax rates (ETI) using tax return data.  First, we provide a theoretical framework showing under what assumptions this elasticity can be used as a sufficient statistic for efficiency and optimal tax analysis.  We discuss what other parameters should be estimated when the elasticity is not a sufficient statistic.  Second, we discuss conceptually the key issues that arise in the empirical estimation of the elasticity of taxable income using the example of the 1993 top individual income tax rate increase in the United States to illustrate those issues.  Third, we provide a critical discussion of most of the taxable income elasticities studies to date, both in the United States and abroad, in light of the theoretical and empirical framework we laid out.

"Cash-out or flame-out! opportunity cost and entrepreneurial strategy theory, and evidence from the information security industry /",Economic theory,"""We analyze how entrepreneurial opportunity cost conditions performance.  We depart from the literature on entrepreneurship which identifies survival with performance.  Instead, many entrepreneurs aim for a cash-out (IPO or acquisition), especially in innovation based industries.  Striving for a cash-out makes mistakes more likely and increases the probability of failure.  High opportunity cost entrepreneurs will attempt to cash-out (IPO or friendly acquisition) quickly, even if it implies a higher risk of failure.  Entrepreneurs with fewer outside alternatives may tend to linger on longer.  We formalize this intuition with a simple model.  Using a novel dataset of information security startups we find that entrepreneurs with high opportunity costs are not only more likely to cash-out but they are also more likely to fail.  As well, our results confirm the predicted role of venture quality in conditioning the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity cost and entrepreneurial performance""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
International trade and domestic regulation,Economic theory,"""Existing formal models of the relationship between trade policy and regulatory policy suggest the potential for a regulatory race to the bottom.  WTO rules and disputes, however, center on complaints about excessively stringent regulations.  This paper bridges the gap between the existing formal literature and the actual pattern of rules and disputes.  Employing the terms-of-trade framework for the modeling of trade agreements, we show how ""large"" nations may have an incentive to impose discriminatory product standards against imported goods once border instruments are constrained, and how inefficiently stringent standards may emerge under certain circumstances even if regulatory discrimination is prohibited.  We then assess the WTO legal framework in light of our results, arguing that it does a reasonably thorough job of policing regulatory discrimination, but that it does relatively little to address excessive nondiscriminatory regulations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trade elasticity of substitution and equilibrium dynamics,Finance,"""The empirical literature provides a wide range of estimates for trade elasticities at the aggregate level.  Furthermore, recent contributions in international macroeconomics suggest that low (implied) values of the trade elasticity of substitution may play an important role in understanding the disconnect between international prices and real variables.  However, a standard model of the international business cycle displays multiple locally isolated equilibria if the trade elasticity of substitution is sufficiently low.  The main contribution of this paper is to compute and characterize some dynamic properties of these equilibria.  While multiple steady states clearly signal equilibrium multiplicity in the dynamic setup, this is not a necessary condition.  Solutions based on log-linearization around a deterministic steady state are of limited to no help in computing the true dynamics.  However, the log-linear solution can hint at the presence of multiple dynamic equilibria""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Testing the expectations hypothesis when interest rates are near integrated,Finance,"""Nominal interest rates are unlikely to be generated by unit-root processes.  Using data on short and long interest rates from eight developed and six emerging economies, we test the expectations hypothesis using cointegration methods under the assumption that interest rates are near integrated.  If the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected, we then test whether the estimated cointegrating vector is consistent with that suggested by the expectations hypothesis.  The results show support for cointegration in ten of the fourteen countries we consider, and the cointegrating vector is similar across countries.  However, the parameters differ from those suggested by theory.  We relate our findings to existing literature on the failure of the expectations hypothesis and to the role of term premia""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
MHbounds -- sensitivity analysis for average treatment effects,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Matching has become a popular approach to estimate average treatment effects. It is based on the conditional independence or unconfoundedness assumption. Checking the sensitivity of the estimated results with respect to deviations from this identifying assumption has become an increasingly important topic in the applied evaluation literature. If there are unobserved variables which affect assignment into treatment and the outcome variable simultaneously, a hidden bias might arise to which matching estimators are not robust. We address this problem with the bounding approach proposed by Rosenbaum (2002), where mhbounds allows the researcher to determine how strongly an unmeasured variable must influence the selection process in order to undermine the implications of the matching analysis""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Testing the specification of the Mincer wage equation,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""I perform the joint estimation of a reduced-form dynamic model of the transition from one grade level to the next, and a Mincer wage equation, using panel data taken from the NLSY. A very high degree of flexibility is achieved by approximating the distributions of idiosyncractic grade transition shocks and wage shocks with high dimensional normal mixtures. The model rejects all simplifying assumptions common in the empirical literature. In particular, the log wage regression is highly convex, even after conditioning on unobserved and observed skills. Skill heterogeneity is also found to be over-estimated when non-linearity is ignored. After conditioning on skill heterogeneity, I also find evidence of non-separability between the effect of schooling and experience (schooling has a positive effect on wage growth). Finally, the variance of the idiosyncratic wage shock is reduced by obtaining higher education""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Status, happiness, and relative income","Industries, Land use, Labor","""Models of status based on Frank's (1985) count of the number of people with lower conspicuous consumption are inconsistent with the extensive empirical literature on happiness and well-being. The alternative approach to consumption interaction which uses some form of relative income has been developed in various contexts. These predict that a representative agent's well-being will increase with real income or consumption. However, this is again inconsistent with the time-series evidence for advanced economies. In this paper we combine a simple model of relative income with a distribution of ability that correctly predicts both time series results of near constant utility, and the positive, concave cross-sectional relation between income, working time and happiness""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Incomplete information and self-fulfilling prophecies,Economic theory,"""This paper shows that incomplete information can be a rich source of sunspots equilibria.  This is demonstrated in a standard dynamic general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition à la Dixit-Stiglitz.  In the absence of fundamental shocks, the model has a unique certainty (fundamental) equilibrium, but there are also multiple stochastic (sunspots) equilibria that are not mere randomizations over fundamental equilibria.  In other words, sunspots can exist in infinite-horizon dynamic models with a unique saddle path steady state.  In contrast to the recent sunspots literature (e.g., Benhabib and Farmer 1994), sunspots arising under incomplete information can be serially correlated and are robust to parameters associated with production technologies and preferences.  Markup is always countercyclical in sunspots equilibria (which is consistent with empirical evidence) and fluctuations driven by sunspots look very similar to fluctuations driven by technology shocks""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Who gives for overseas development?,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Individuals' donations to overseas charities are an important source of funding for development assistance from rich industrialised countries. But little is known about the nature of these charitable donations. The literature on giving focuses on total donations to all causes and does not identify separately the pattern or the determinants of giving to any particular cause. We investigate giving to overseas causes using UK survey microdata that record individuals' donations to different types of charity. We establish a picture of overseas giving, comparing this with giving to other causes. Socio-economic correlates of both types of giving are analysed, including gender, marital status, occupation, education and, especially, income. We also investigate the relationship between individuals' overseas giving and their attitudes towards poverty in developing countries""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Segregation and the black-white test score gap,Economic theory,"""The mid-1980s witnessed breaks in two important trends related to race and schooling.  School segregation, which had been declining, began a period of relative stasis.  Black-white test score gaps, which had also been declining, also stagnated.  The notion that these two phenomena may be related is also supported by basic cross-sectional evidence.  We review existing literature on the relationship between neighborhood- and school-level segregation and the test score gap.  Several recent studies point to a statistically significant causal relationship between school segregation and the test score gap, though in many cases the magnitude of the relationship is small in economic terms.  Experimental studies, as well as methodologically convincing non-experimental studies, suggest that there is little if any causal role for neighborhood segregation operating through a mechanism other than school segregation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Social learning and monetary policy rules,Economic theory,"""We analyze the effects of social learning in a widely-studied monetary policy context.  Social learning might be viewed as more descriptive of actual learning behavior in complex market economies.  Ideas about how best to forecast the economy's state vector are initially heterogeneous.  Agents can copy better forecasting techniques and discard those techniques which are less successful.  We seek to understand whether the economy will converge to a rational expectations equilibrium under this more realistic learning dynamic.  A key result from the literature in the version of the model we study is that the Taylor Principle governs both the uniqueness and the expectational stability of the rational expectations equilibrium when all agents learn homogeneously using recursive algorithms.  We find that the Taylor Principle is not necessary for convergence in a social learning context.  We also contribute to the use of genetic algorithm learning in stochastic environments""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."

Outsourcing and volatility,Economic theory,"""While outsourcing of production from the U.S.  to Mexico has been hailed in Mexico as a valuable engine of growth, recently there have been misgivings regarding its fickleness and volatility.  This paper is among the first in the trade literature to study the second moment properties of outsourcing.  We begin by documenting a new stylized fact: the maquiladora outsourcing industries in Mexico experience fluctuations in value added that are roughly twice as volatile as the corresponding industries in the U.S.  A difference-in-difference method is extended to second moments to verify the statistical significance of this finding.  We then develop a stochastic model of outsourcing with heterogeneous firms that can explain this volatility.  The model employs two novel mechanisms: an extensive margin in outsourcing which responds endogenously to transmit shocks internationally, and translog preferences which modulate firm entry""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Interest rate rules, inflation stabilization, and imperfect credibility the small open economy case /",Economic theory,"""The paper examines the robustness of Interest Rate Rules, IRRs, in the context of an imperfectly credible stabilization program, closely following the format of much of the literature in open-economy models, e.g., Calvo and Vǧh (1993 and 1999).  A basic result is that IRRs, like Exchange Rate Based Stabilization, ERBS, programs, could give rise to macroeconomic distortion, e.g., underutilization of capacity and real exchange rate misalignment.  However, while under imperfect credibility EBRS is associated with overheating and current account deficits, IRRs give rise to somewhat opposite results.  Moreover, the paper shows that popular policies to counteract misalignment, like Strategic Foreign Exchange Market Intervention or Controls on International Capital Mobility may not be effective or could even become counterproductive.  The bottom line is that the greater exchange rate flexibility granted by IRRs is by far not a sure shot against the macroeconomic costs infringed by imperfect credibility""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Why is economic policy different in new democracies? affecting attitudes about democracy /,Economic theory,"""When democracy is new, it is often fragile and not fully consolidated.  We investigate how the danger of a collapse of democracy may affect fiscal policy in new democracies in comparison to countries where democracy is older and often more established.  We argue that the attitude of the citizenry towards democracy is important in preventing democratic collapse, and expenditures may therefore be used to convince them that ""democracy works"".  We present a model focusing on the inference problem that citizens solve in forming their beliefs about the efficacy of democracy.  Our approach differs from much of the literature that concentrates on policy directed towards anti-democratic elites, but our model can encompass that view and allows comparison of different apporoaches.  We argue that the implications of the model are broadly consistent with the empirical patterns generally observed, including the existence of political budget cycles in new democracies not observed in established democracies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The effects of work-conditioned transfers on marriage and child well-being a review /,Economic theory,"""Transfer payments to poor families are increasingly conditioned on work, either via wage subsidies available only to workers or via work requirements in more traditional welfare programs.

We review a small number of studies that provide such information here.  Our discussion of marriage is couched in terms of a theoretical model that draws from the efficient-household literature.  The model is consistent with the wide range of effects that we observe and suggests an explanation for some of the observed differences.

"Sudden stops determinants and output effects in the first era of globalization, 1880-1913 /",Economic theory,"""Using a sample of 20 emerging countries from 1880 to 1913, we study the determinants and output effects of sudden stops in capital inflows during an era of intensified globalization.  We find that higher levels of original sin (hard currency debt to total debt) and large current account deficits associated with reliance on foreign capital greatly increased the likelihood of experiencing a sudden stop.  Trade openness and stronger commitment to the gold standard had the opposite effect.  These results are robust for many sudden stop definitions used in the literature.  Finally, we use a treatment effects model to show that after controlling for endogeneity sudden stops have a strong negative association with growth in per capita output.  We also show that banking, currency and debt crises that were preceded by a sudden stop have much greater negative relation with growth than in the absence of a sudden stop""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Our reading of the evidence suggests that paternalism and interdependent preferences are leading overall explanations for the existence of in-kind transfer programs, but that some of the other arguments may apply to specific cases.

Consistently with the related managerial and economic literature, our basic result is that current skill endowment may significantly and positively influence a firm's current R&D decision.

It uses microdata from the 2000 US Census, a model of language acquisition from the economics and sociology literatures, and a flexible specification of an estimating equation based on 64 age-at-migration dichotomous variables. It shows that self-reported English language speaking proficiency among immigrants declines more-or-less monotonically with age at migration, and this relationship is not characterized by any sharp decline or discontinuity that might be considered consistent with a ""critical"" period.

We here use co-workers. Their wages not only induce jealousy, but also provide a signal about the worker's own future earnings. Our positive estimated coefficient on others' wages shows that this positive future earnings signal outweighs any negative status effect.

It is shown that the efficiency of these solutions is very sensitive to the characteristics of the good or service exchanged.

Our analysis departs from the literature in two ways, both of which show that previous estimates of the ethnic-network elasticity of trade are sensitive to the restrictions imposed on the estimated models. Our first departure is to control for unobserved heterogeneity with properly specified fixed effects, which we can do because our dataset contains a time dimension absent from previous studies. Our second departure is to remove the restriction that the network effect is the same for all ethnicities.

"Housing, portfolio choice, and the macroeconomy",Economic theory,"""Much of the macroeconomics literature dealing with wealth distribution has abstracted from modeling housing explicitly. This paper investigates the properties of the wealth distribution and the portfolio composition regarding housing and equity holdings and their relationship to macroeconomic shocks. To this end, I construct a business cycle model in which agents differ in age, income, and wealth and derive utility from housing services. The model is consistent with several facts such as the life-cycle pattern of housing-to-wealth ratios, the larger degree of concentration for nonhousing wealth, and the smaller weight of housing in richer households' portfolios as well as the larger housing-to-wealth ratios in recessions. In addition, the model delivers the familiar business-cycle moments regarding relative standard deviations and procyclicality of consumption, investment, and employment""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Using target efficiency to select program participants and risk-factor models an application to child mental health interventions for preventing future crime /,Economic theory,"""Statistical risk factor models are often proposed for screening high-risk children to participate in early intervention programs.  Recent contributions to the program evaluation literature demonstrate the need for incorporating judgments about relative importance of false positives versus false negatives in screening.  This paper formalizes these judgments as commensurable economic costs and benefits and applies them to demonstrate an approach to participant selection motivated by the standard cost-benefit criterion of maximizing expected net benefits.  Implications of this approach are explored using data from a mental health prevention trial.  We illustrate the response of expected net benefits to the choice of a selection risk level, the sensitivity of the optimal selection risk level to per participant cost/benefit magnitudes, and the use of the target-efficiency approach for choosing among alternative risk-factor models.  Several strategies that directly incorporate expected net benefit maximization as a criterion in the model estimation process are also examined""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Welfare work requirements with paternalistic government preferences,Economic theory,"""Work requirements in means-tested transfer programs have grown in importance in the U.S.  and in some other countries.  The theoretical literature which considers their possible optimality generally operates within a traditional welfarist framework where some function of the utility of the poor is maximized.  Here we consider a case where society is paternalistic and instead has preferences over the actual work allocations of welfare recipients.  With this social welfare function, optimality of work requirements is possible but depends on the accuracy of the screening mechanism which assigns work requirements to some benefit recipients and not others.  Numerical simulations show that the accuracy must be high for such optimality to occur.  The simulations also show that earnings subsidies can be justified with the type of social welfare function used here""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Winners and losers from enacting the financial modernization statute,Economic theory,"""Previous studies of the announcement effects of relaxing administrative and legislative restraints show that signal events leading up to the enactment of the Financial Services Modernization Act (FSMA) increased the prices of financial-institution stocks.  An unsettled question is whether the gains observed for these stocks arise from projected increases in efficiency or from reductions in customer bargaining power.  This paper documents that some of the value increase came at the expense of potential and actual customers.  The stock prices of credit-constrained customers declined during FSMA event windows and experienced significant increases in beta in the wake of its enactment.  These findings reinforce evidence in the literature on bank mergers that large-bank consolidation is unfavorably affecting the availability of credit for capital-constrained firms""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
New technology in schools is there a payoff? /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Despite its high relevance to current policy debates, estimating the causal effect of Information Communication Technology (ICT) investment on educational standards remains fraught with difficulties.

The approach identifies the effect of being a 'winner' or a 'loser' in the new system of ICT funding allocation to schools. Our findings suggest a positive impact on primary school performance in English and Science, though not for Mathematics. We reconcile our positive results with others in the literature by arguing that it is the joint effect of large increases in ICT funding coupled with a fertile background for making an efficient use of it that led to positive effects of ICT expenditure on educational performance in English primary schools""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

Towards a unifying approach of the 'new economic geography',"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Models of the new economic geography share a number of common conclusions, but also exhibit notable differences, in particular with respect to the shape of the location pattern and the efficiency of the market equilibrium. This reflects the fact that these models rely heavily on specific functional forms. In this paper we approach the properties of the 'footloose entrepreneur' class of new economic geography models with a unifying framework based on the indirect utility function of mobile agents. This approach has several payoffs. We are able to provide general, yet handy, formulae to determine the break point, the bifurcation pattern and the welfare properties of the market equilibrium. Moreover, an application of this framework allows us to show how specific results in the literature can be reconciled as special cases, thereby allowing us to highlight the origin of their differences""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Skill wage premia, employment, and cohort effects are workers in Germany all of the same type? /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper studies the relationship between employment and wage structures in West Germany based on the IAB employment subsample 1975-1997. It extends the analytical framework of Card and Lemieux (2001) which simultaneously includes skill and age as important dimensions of heterogeneity. After having identified cohort effects in skill wage premia and in the evolution of relative employment measures, we estimate elasticities of substitution between employees in three different skill groups and between those of different age, taking account of the endogeneity of wages and employment. Compared to estimates in the related literature, we find a rather high degree of substitutability. Drawing on the estimated parameters, we simulate the magnitude of wage changes within the respective skill groups that would have been necessary to halve skill-specific unemployment rates in 1997. The required nominal wage reductions range from 8.8 to 12.2% and are the higher the lower the employees' skill level""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Imperfect competition and sunspots,Economic theory,"""This paper shows that imperfect competition can be a rich source of sunspots equilibria and coordination failures.

But there is also a continuum of stochastic (sunspots) equilibria that are not mere randomizations over fundamental equilibria.  Markup is always counter-cyclical in sunspots equilibria, which is consistent with empirical evidence.  The paper provides a justification for exogenous variations over time in desired markups, which play an important role as a source of cost-push shocks in the monetary policy literature.  We show that fluctuations driven by self-fulfilling expectations (or sunspots) look very similar to fluctuations driven by technology shocks, and we prove that such fluctuations are welfare reducing""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
The choice between income and consumption taxes a primer /,Economic theory,"""It has now been nearly three decades since the publication of two important volumes that laid out many of the details of how one might implement a progressive consumption tax (Institute for Fiscal Studies, 1978; U.S.  Treasury, 1977).  Over the years since, many contributions have analyzed the mechanics of the different variants of consumption taxation, the potential efficiency and distributional effects of their adoption, the issues of administration and transition from the current tax system, and the problems relating to certain types of transactions.  But much of what we ""know"" is not part of the general policy discussion and there are important issues that the literature has recognized but still not resolved.  The aim of this paper is to lay out the key economic issues involved in deciding whether and how to adopt a consumption tax and to discuss what theory and evidence have told us and could tell us about these issues""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Capital account liberalization theory, evidence, and speculation /",Economic theory,"""Writings on the macroeconomic impact of capital account liberalization find few, if any, robust effects of liberalization on real variables.  In contrast to the prevailing wisdom, I argue that the textbook theory of liberalization holds up quite well to a critical reading of this literature.  The lion's share of papers that find no effect of liberalization on real variables tell us nothing about the empirical validity of the theory, because they do not really test it.  This paper explains why it is that most studies do not really address the theory they set out to test.  It also discusses what is necessary to test the theory and examines papers that have done so.  Studies that actually test the theory show that liberalization has significant effects on the cost of capital, investment, and economic growth""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Crime and circumstance the effects of infant health shocks on fathers' criminal activity /,Economic theory,"""Few studies in the economics literature have linked individuals' criminal behavior to changes in their personal circumstances.  Life shocks, such as natural or personal disasters, could reduce or sever a person's connections to his/her family, job, or community.  With fewer connections, crime may become a more attractive option.  This study addresses the question of whether an exogenous shock in life circumstances affects criminal activity.  Specifically, we estimate the effects of the birth of a child with a random and serious health problem (versus the birth of a healthy infant) on the likelihood that the child's father becomes or remains involved in illegal activities.  Controlling for the father's pre-birth criminal activity, we find that the shock of having a child with a serious health problem increases both the father's post-birth conviction and incarceration by 1 to 8 percentage points, depending on the measure of infant health used""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Judicial risk and credit market performance micro evidence from brazilian payroll loans /,Economic theory,"""A large body of literature has stressed the institution-development nexus as critical in explaining differences in countries' economic performance.  The empirical evidence, however, has been mainly at the aggregate level, associating macro performance with measures of quality of institutions.  This paper, by relating a judicial decision on the legality of payroll loans in Brazil to bank-level decision variables, provides micro evidence on how creditor legal protection affects market performance.  Payroll loans are personal loans with principal and interests payments directly deducted from the borrowers' payroll check, which, in practice, makes a collateral out of future income.  In June 2004, a high-level federal court upheld a regional court ruling that had declared payroll deduction illegal.  Using personal loans without payroll deduction as a control group, we assess whether the ruling had an impact on market performance.  Evidence indicates that it had an adverse impact on risk perception, interest rates, and amount lent""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Stock and bond returns with moody investors,Economic theory,"""We present a tractable, linear model for the simultaneous pricing of stock and bond returns that incorporates stochastic risk aversion.  In this model, analytic solutions for endogenous stock and bond prices and returns are readily calculated.  After estimating the parameters of the model by the general method of moments, we investigate a series of classic puzzles of the empirical asset pricing literature.  In particular, our model is shown to jointly accommodate the mean and volatility of equity and long term bond risk premia as well as salient features of the nominal short rate, the dividend yield, and the term spread.  Also, the model matches the evidence for predictability of excess stock and bond returns.  However, the stock-bond return correlation implied by the model is somewhat higher than in the data""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Globalization and risk sharing,Economic theory,"""This paper presents a theoretical study of the eÞects of globalization on risk sharing and welfare.  We model globalization as a gradual and exogenous increase in the fraction of goods that are tradable.  In the absence of frictions, globalization opens new goods markets and raises welfare.  We assume, however, that countries cannot commit to pay their debts.  Unlike the previous literature, and motivated by changes in the institutional setup of emerging-market borrowing, we also assume that countries cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors when paying their debts.  Although globalization still opens new goods markets, we find that it can also open or close some asset markets.  The net eÞect on risk sharing and welfare of this process of creation and destruction of markets might be either positive or negative depending on a variety of factors that the theory highlights""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Testing for restricted stochastic dominance,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Asymptotic and bootstrap tests are studied for testing whether there is a relation of stochastic dominance between two distributions. These tests have a null hypothesis of nondominance, with the advantage that, if this null is rejected, then all that is left is dominance. This also leads us to define and focus on restricted stochastic dominance, the only empirically useful form of dominance relation that we can seek to infer in many settings. One testing procedure that we consider is based on an empirical likelihood ratio. The computations necessary for obtaining a test statistic also provide estimates of the distributions under study that satisfy the null hypothesis, on the frontier between dominance and nondominance. These estimates can be used to perform bootstrap tests that can turn out to provide much improved reliability of inference compared with the asymptotic tests so far proposed in the literature""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Firms' environmental performance does news matter ? /,Finance,"""The empirical literature on environmental performance or compliance has followed two strands: one based on the impact of formal regulation as a means of inducing better environmental performance, and another centered on the role of informal regulation which mainly emphasizes the role of communities and capital markets.  The authors analyze the impact of environmental news in print media on firms' environmental performance.  Using data from a survey of industrial facilities in the Republic of Korea, probit estimation results indicate that the publication of environmental news in print media and the firm's awareness of this publication are important predictors of a firm's environmental performance, more so than environmental laws, regulations, and environmental training.  This paper thus reemphasizes the key role of media in influencing firms' environmental performance. ""--World Bank web site."
International financial integration through the law of one price,Finance,"""The authors argue that the cross-market premium (the ratio between the domestic and the international market price of cross-listed stocks) provides a valuable measure of international financial integration, reflecting accurately the factors that segment markets and inhibit price arbitrage.  Applying to equity markets recent methodological developments in the purchasing power parity literature, they show that nonlinear Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) models properly capture the behavior of the cross market premium.  The estimates reveal the presence of narrow non-arbitrage bands and indicate that price differences outside these bands are rapidly arbitraged away, much faster than what has been documented for good markets.  Moreover, the authors find that financial integration increases with market liquidity.  Capital controls, when binding, contribute to segment financial markets by widening the non-arbitrage bands and making price disparities more persistent.  Crisis episodes are associated with higher volatility, rather than by more persistent deviations from the law of one price. ""--World Bank web site."
Regional labor market developments in transition,Finance,"""The author analyzes regional labor market disparities in transition by presenting some data and summarizing existing literature.  He finds that large and persistent regional labor market disparities developed in virtually all transition countries and that there is some evidence of polarization.  Differences in starting conditions and market access seem to be the major reasons for regional divergence in transition.  Furthermore, regional wages are only slightly more flexible than in many European Union labor markets, interregional migration is low, and capital seems to move toward high wage and low unemployment urban centers rather than to the most backward regions.  Policy should thus take a long-run perspective on the existing regional disparities, focus on removing barriers to mobility, review existing institutions for implementing regional policy, and aim at a close coordination of regional and labor market policy instruments.

The role of opinion leaders in the diffusion of new knowledge the case of integrated pest management /,Finance,"""The paper reviews the literature on the characteristics and impact of opinion leaders on the diffusion of new knowledge, concluding that there is no clear evidence on whether opinion leaders are more effective if they are similar in socioeconomic attributes to the other farmers rather than superior to would be followers.  A multivariate analysis of the changes in integrated pest management knowledge in Indonesia among follower farmers over the period 1991-98 indicates that opinion leaders who are superior to followers, but not excessively so, are more effective in transmitting knowledge.  Excessive socioeconomic distance is shown to reduce the effectiveness of diffusion.  The paper then derives operational implications of the empirical results. ""--World Bank web site."
Can sticky price models generate volatile and persistent real exchange rates? (December 1998 version),Economic theory,"""The conventional wisdom is that monetary shocks interact with sticky goods prices to generate the observed volatility and persistence in real exchange rates. We investigate this conventional wisdom in a quantitative model with sticky prices. We find that with preferences as in the real business cycle literature, irrespective of the length of price stickiness, the model necessarily produces only a fraction of the volatility in exchange rates seen in the data. With preferences which are separable in leisure, the model can produce the observed volatility in exchange rates. We also show that long stickiness is necessary to generate the observed persistence. In addition, we show that making asset markets incomplete does not measurably increase either the volatility or persistence of real exchange rates""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
When does determinacy imply expectational stability?,Economic theory,"""We study the connections between determinacy of rational expectations equilibrium, and expectational stability or learnability of that equilibrium, in a relatively general New Keynesian model.  Adoption of policies that induce both determinacy and learnability of equilibrium has been considered fundamental to successful policy in the literature.  We ask what types of economic assumptions drive differences in the necessary and sufficient conditions for the two criteria.  Our framework is sufficiently flexible to encompass lags in information, alternative pricing assumptions, a cost channel for monetary policy, and either Euler equation or infinite horizon approaches to learning.  We are able to isolate conditions under which determinacy does and does not imply learnability, and also conditions under which long horizon forecasts make a clear difference to conclusions about expectational stability.  The sharpest result is that informational delays break equivalence connections between determinacy and learnability""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
A residual-based cointegration test for near unit root variables,Finance,"""Methods of inference based on a unit root assumption in the data are typically not robust to even small deviations from this assumption.  In this paper, we propose robust procedures for a residual-based test of cointegration when the data are generated by a near unit root process.  A Bonferroni method is used to address the uncertainty regarding the exact degree of persistence in the process.  We thus provide a method for valid inference in multivariate near unit root processes where standard cointegration tests may be subject to substantial size distortions and standard OLS inference may lead to spurious results.  Empirical illustrations are given by: (i) a re-examination of the Fisher hypothesis, and (ii) a test of the validity of the cointegrating relationship between aggregate consumption, asset holdings, and labor income, which has attracted a great deal of attention in the recent finance literature""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Why do women leave science and engineering?,Economic theory,"""I use the 1993 and 2003 National Surveys of College Graduates to examine the higher exit rate of women compared to men from science and engineering relative to other fields.  I find that the higher relative exit rate is driven by engineering rather than science, and show that 60% of the gap can be explained by the relatively greater exit rate from engineering of women dissatisfied with pay and promotion opportunities.  Contrary to the existing literature, I find that family-related constraints and dissatisfaction with working conditions are only secondary factors.  My results differ due to my use of non-science and engineering fields as a comparison group.  The relative exit rate by gender from engineering does not differ from that of other fields once women's relatively high exit rates from male fields generally is taken into account""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Field experiments in labor economics,Economic theory,"""We overview the use of field experiments in labor economics.  We showcase studies that highlight the central advantages of this methodology, which include: (i) using economic theory to design the null and alternative hypotheses; (ii) engineering exogenous variation in real world economic environments to establish causal relations and learning about the underlying mechanisms; and (iii) engaging in primary data collection and often working closely with practitioners.  To highlight the potential for field experiments to inform issues in labor economics, we organize our discussion around the individual life cycle.  We therefore consider field experiments related to the accumulation of human capital, the demand and supply of labor, behavior within firms, and close with a brief discussion of the nascent literature of field experiments related to household decision-making""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Human resource management and productivity,Economic theory,"""In this handbook of labor economics chapter we examine the relationship between Human Resource Management (HRM) and productivity.  HRM includes incentive pay (individual and group) as well as many non-pay aspects of the employment relationship such as matching (hiring and firing) and work organization (e.g.  teams, autonomy).  We place HRM more generally within the literature on management practices and productivity.  We start with some facts on levels and trends of both HRM and productivity and the main economic theories of HRM.  We look at some of the determinants of HRM - risk, competition, ownership and regulation.  The largest section analyses the impact of HRM on productivity emphasizing issues of methodology, data and results (from micro-econometric studies).  We conclude briefly with suggestions of avenues for future frontier work""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Decomposition methods in economics,Economic theory,"""This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of decomposition methods that have been developed since the seminal work of Oaxaca and Blinder in the early 1970s.  These methods are used to decompose the difference in a distributional statistic between two groups, or its change over time, into various explanatory factors.  While the original work of Oaxaca and Blinder considered the case of the mean, our main focus is on other distributional statistics besides the mean such as quantiles, the Gini coefficient or the variance.  We discuss the assumptions required for identifying the different elements of the decomposition, as well as various estimation methods proposed in the literature.  We also illustrate how these methods work in practice by discussing existing applications and working through a set of empirical examples throughout the paper""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Religious identity and economic behavior,Economic theory,"""Although many scholars (e.g., Weber, 1930) have hypothesized that religious identity norms affect economic outcomes, empirical tests have been hampered by the difficulty of identifying exogenous variation in religion.  We create exogenous variation by randomly varying religious identity salience in laboratory subjects.  The marginal effect of religious identity is the change in subjects' choices when religion is salient.  We test six hypotheses from prior literature.  We find that Protestantism increases contributions to public goods.  Catholicism decreases contributions to public goods, decreases expectations of others' contributions to public goods, and decreases risk aversion.  Judaism increases worker reciprocity in a bilateral labor market gift-exchange game.  We find no evidence of religious identity effects on disutility of work effort, discount rates, or generosity in a dictator game""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Borders, ethnicity and trade",Economic theory,"""Do national borders and ethnicity contribute to market segmentation between and within countries? This paper uses unique and high-frequency data on narrowly-defined goods to gauge the extent to which a national border impedes trade between developing countries (Niger and Nigeria).  Using a regression discontinuity approach, we find a significant price change at the national border, but one that is lower in magnitude than that found for industrialized countries.  Yet unlike that literature, and in line with important characteristics of African economies, we investigate the role of ethnicity in mitigating and exacerbating the border effect.  We find that a common ethnicity is linked to lower price dispersion across countries, yet ethnic diversity creates an internal border within Niger.  The primary mechanism behind the internal border effect appears to be related to the role of ethnicity in facilitating access to credit in rural markets""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The shape of temptation implications for the economic lives of the poor /,Economic theory,"""This paper argues that the relation between temptations and the level of consumption plays a key role in explaining the observed behaviors of the poor.  Temptation goods are defined to be the set of goods that generate positive utility for the self that consumes them, but not for any previous self that anticipates that they will be consumed in the future.  We show that the assumption of declining temptations, which says that the fraction of the marginal dollar that is spent on temptation goods decreases with overall consumption, has a number of striking implications for the investment, savings, borrowing and risk-taking behavior of the poor, which would not arise if temptations were either non-declining or entirely absent.  Moreover the predicted behaviors under the declining temptation assumption can help us explain some of the puzzling facts about the poor that have been emphasized in the recent literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Econometric methods for research in education,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews some of the econometric methods that have been used in the economics of education.  The focus is on understanding how the assumptions made to justify and implement such methods relate to the underlying economic model and the interpretation of the results.  We start by considering the estimation of the returns to education both within the context of a dynamic discrete choice model inspired by Willis and Rosen (1979) and in the context of the Mincer model.  We discuss the relationship between the econometric assumptions and economic behaviour.  We then discuss methods that have been used in the context of assessing the impact of education quality, the teacher contribution to pupils' achievement and the effect of school quality on housing prices.  In the process we also provide a summary of some of the main results in this literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Taxing guns vs. taxing crime an application of the ""market for offenses model"" /",Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  The interaction between offenders and potential victims has so far received relatively little attention in the literature on the economics of crime.  The main objective of this paper is twofold: to extend the ""market for offenses model"" to deal with both ""product"" and ""factor"" markets, and to apply it to the case where guns are used for crime commission by offenders and for self-protection by potential victims.  Our analysis offers new insights about the association between crime and guns and the limits it imposes on the efficacy of law enforcement and regulatory policies aimed to control both crime and guns""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
International business cycle synchronization in historical perspective,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we review and attempt to explain the changes in business cycle synchronization among 16 industrial countries and the over the past century and a quarter, demarcated into four exchange rate regimes.  We find that there is a secular trend towards increased synchronization for much of the twentieth century and that it occurs across diverse exchange rate regimes.  This finding is in marked contrast to much of the recent literature, which has focused primarily on the evidence for the past 20 or 30 years and which has produced mixed results.  We then examine the role of global shocks and shock transmission in the trend toward synchronization.  Our key finding here is that global (common) shocks generally are the dominant influence""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Evaluating the slow adoption of energy efficient investments : are renters less likely to have energy efficient appliances?,Economic theory,"""While public discussion of HR 2454 (the ""Waxman Markey"" bill) has focused on the cap-andtrade program that would be established for carbon emissions, the bill also includes provisions that would tighten energy efficiency standards for consumer appliances.  Supporters argue that appliance standards help address a number of market failures.  In particular, many studies have pointed out that landlords may buy cheap inefficient appliances when their tenants pay the utility bill.  Although this landlord-tenant problem has been widely discussed in the literature, there is little empirical evidence on the magnitude of the distortion.  This paper compares appliance ownership patterns between homeowners and renters using household-level data from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey.  The results show that, controlling for household income and other household characteristics, renters are significantly less likely to have energy efficient refrigerators, clothes washers and dishwashers""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
What goods do countries trade? a quantitative exploration of Ricardo's ideas /,Economic theory,"""The Ricardian model predicts that countries should produce and export relatively more in industries in which they are relatively more productive.  Though one of the most celebrated insights in the theory of international trade, this prediction has received virtually no attention in the empirical literature since the mid-sixties.  The main reason behind this lack of popularity is the absence of clear theoretical foundations to guide the empirical analysis.  Building on the seminal work of Eaton and Kortum (2002), the present paper offers such foundations and uses them to quantify the importance of Ricardian comparative advantage.  Using trade and productivity data from 1997, we estimate that, ceteris paribus, the elasticity of bilateral exports with respect to observed productivity is 6.53.  From a welfare standpoint, however, the removal of Ricardian comparative advantage at the industry level would only lead, on average, to a 5.5% decrease in the total gains from trade""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Money and interest rates in the United States during the Great Depression,Economic theory,"""This paper reexamines the debate over whether the United States fell into a liquidity trap in the 1930s.  We first review the literature on the liquidity trap focusing on Keynes's discussion of ""absolute liquidity preference"" and the division that soon emerged between Keynes, who believed that a liquidity trap had not been reached, and the American Keynesians who believed that the United States had fallen into a liquidity trap.  We then explore several interest rates that have been neglected in previous analyses: yields on corporate debt (from Aaa to junk), bank lending rates, and mortgage rates.  In general, our results strengthen the case for believing that there was no liquidity trap in the 1930s in the sense of one that covered the full spectrum of interest rates.  The small segment of time in which a liquidity trap might have been present, however, makes drawing firm conclusions risky""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
An empirical analysis of cost recovery in superfund cases implications for brownfields and joint and several liability /,Economic theory,"""Economic theory developed in the prior literature indicates that under the joint and several liability imposed by the federal Superfund statute, the government should recover more of its costs of cleaning up contaminated sites than it would under nonjoint liability, and the amount recovered should increase with the number of defendants and with the independence among defendants in trial outcomes.  We test these predictions empirically using data on outcomes in federal Superfund cases.  Theory also suggests that this increase in the amount recovered may discourage the sale and redevelopment of potentially contaminated sites (or ""brownfields"").  We find the increase to be substantial, which suggests that this implicit tax on sales may be an important deterrent for parties contemplating brownfields redevelopment""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Bounds on elasticities with optimization frictions a synthesis of micro and macro evidence on labor supply /,Economic theory,"""I derive bounds on price elasticities in a dynamic model that is mis-specified due to optimization frictions such as adjustment costs or inattention.  The bounds are a function of the observed effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions.  I measure the degree of frictions by the utility losses agents tolerate to make choices that deviate from the frictionless optimum.  I apply these bounds to the literature on taxation and labor supply, allowing for frictions of 1% of consumption in choosing labor supply.  Such small frictions reconcile the difference between micro and macro elasticities, extensive and intensive margin elasticities, and several other disparate findings.  Pooling estimates from twenty existing studies yields bounds on the intensive margin labor supply elasticity of (0.47,0.54)""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Human capital, endogenous information acquisition, and home bias in financial markets",Economic theory,"""Considerable attention has been devoted in the financial literature to excessive portfolio concentrations in domestic risky assets relative to those predicted by standard finance models - generally identified as ""home bias"" - across international markets.  The innovation we offer is ascribing home bias to endogenous information acquisition, or ""asset management"" (see EHY 2008), resulting from variations in human capital endowments.  We develop discriminating hypotheses about the roles of ""specific"" and ""general"" human capital endowments and the direct and opportunity costs of asset management in determining how home bias varies among individual investors and across financial markets.  Our model also provides insights concerning differences across countries in the degree to which their domestic asset prices are ""information revealing"".  These hypotheses are tested against 8 national probability samples of individual portfolio compositions in the US over 1992-2007, and 7 international samples over 2001-2007 including 23 countries.  The findings are consistent with our hypotheses""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Interest groups, information manipulation in the media, and public policy the case of the Landless Peasants Movement in Brazil /",Economic theory,"""We extend the literature on interest group behavior and policy outcomes by examining how groups with limited resources (votes and campaign contributions) effectively influence government by manipulating media information to voters.  Voters in turn lobby politicians to implement the group's preferred policies.  In this manner interest groups can secure favorable government actions beyond their size and wealth.  This is an important contribution because of the increased role of the media in the information age and because this linkage better explains observed government policies.  We develop a multi-principal, multi-task model of interest group behavior and generate the characteristics of interest groups that would be most successful using publicity to secure their policy objectives.  We apply the model to the Landless Peasants' Movement in Brazil.  We detail how the Landless Peasants' Movement molds information; show the general voter response; and examine the reaction of politicians in changing the timing and nature of policy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Economic conditions and the quality of suicide terrorism,Economic theory,"""We analyze the link between economic conditions and the quality of suicide terrorism.  While the existing empirical literature shows that poverty and economic conditions are not correlated with the quantity of terror, theory predicts that poverty and poor economic conditions may affect the quality of terror.  Poor economic conditions may lead more able, better-educated individuals to participate in terror attacks, allowing terror organizations to send better-qualified terrorists to more complex, higher-impact, terror missions.  Using the universe of Palestinian suicide terrorists against Israeli targets between the years 2000 and 2006 we provide evidence on the correlation between economic conditions, the characteristics of suicide terrorists and the targets they attack.

The role of patent protection in (clean/green) technology transfer,Economic theory,"""Global climate change mitigation will require the development and diffusion of a large number and variety of new technologies.  How will patent protection affect this process? In this paper we first review the evidence on the role of patents for innovation and international technology transfer in general.  The literature suggests that patent protection in a host country encourages technology transfer to that country but that its impact on innovation and development is much more ambiguous.  We then discuss the implications of these findings and other technology-specific evidence for the diffusion of climate change-related technologies.  We conclude that the ""double externality"" problem, that is the presence of both environmental and knowledge externalities, implies that patent protection may not be the optimal instrument for encouraging innovation in this area, especially given the range and variety of green technologies as well as the need for local adaptation of technologies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
On the correlation structure of microstructure noise a financial economic approach /,Economic theory,"""We introduce the financial economics of market microstructure into the financial econometrics of asset return volatility estimation.  In particular, we use market microstructure theory to derive the cross-correlation function between latent returns and market microstructure noise, which feature prominently in the recent volatility literature.  The cross-correlation at zero displacement is typically negative, and cross-correlations at nonzero displacements are positive and decay geometrically.  If market makers are sufficiently risk averse, however, the cross-correlation pattern is inverted.

Why isn't mexico rich?,Economic theory,"""Over the last three decades, Mexico has aggressively reformed its economy, opening to foreign trade and investment, achieving fiscal discipline, and privatizing state owned enterprises.  Despite these efforts, the country's economic growth has been lackluster, trailing that of many other developing nations.  In this paper, I review arguments for why Mexico hasn't sustained higher rates of economic growth.  The most prominent suggest that some combination of poorly functioning credit markets, distortions in the supply of non-traded inputs, and perverse incentives for informality creates a drag on productivity growth.  These are factors internal to Mexico.  One possible external factor is that the country has the bad luck of exporting goods that China sells, rather than goods that China buys.

CEO compensation,Economic theory,"""This paper surveys the recent literature on CEO compensation.  The rapid rise in CEO pay over the past 30 years has sparked an intense debate about the nature of the pay-setting process.  Many view the high level of CEO compensation as the result of powerful managers setting their own pay.  Others interpret high pay as the result of optimal contracting in a competitive market for managerial talent.  We describe and discuss the empirical evidence on the evolution of CEO pay and on the relationship between pay and firm performance since the 1930s.  Our review suggests that both managerial power and competitive market forces are important determinants of CEO pay, but that neither approach is fully consistent with the available evidence.  We briefly discuss promising directions for future research""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Does input quality drive measured differences in firm productivity?,Economic theory,"""Firms in the same industry can differ in measured productivity by multiples of 3.  Griliches (1957) suggests one explanation: the quality of inputs differs across firms.  We add labor market history variables such as experience and firm and industry tenure, as well as general human capital measures such as schooling and sex.  We also use the wage bill and worker fixed effects.  We show adding human capital variables and the wage bill decreases the ratio of the 90th to 10th productivity quantiles from 3.27 to 2.68 across eight Danish manufacturing and service industries.  The productivity dispersion decrease is roughly of the same order of magnitude as some competitive effects found in the literature, but input quality measures do not explain most productivity dispersion, despite economically large production function coefficients.  We find that the wage bill explains as much dispersion as human capital measures""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Why have economic reforms in Mexico not generated growth?,Economic theory,"""Following its opening to trade and foreign investment in the mid-1980s, Mexico's economic growth has been modest at best, particularly in comparison with that of China.  Comparing these countries and reviewing the literature, we conclude that the relation between openness and growth is not a simple one.  Using standard trade theory, we find that Mexico has gained from trade, and by some measures, more so than China.  We sketch out a theory in which developing countries can grow faster than the United States by reforming.  As a country becomes richer, this sort of catch-up becomes more difficult.  Absent continuing reforms, Chinese growth is likely to slow down sharply, perhaps leaving China at a level less than Mexico's real GDP per working-age person""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Manumission in nineteenth century Virginia,Economic theory,"""A long-standing debate concerns the rationality of slave owners and this paper addresses that debate within the context of manumission.  Using a new sample of 19th-century Virginia manumissions, I show that manumission was associated with the productive characteristics of slaves.  More productive slaves were manumitted at younger ages than less productive slaves.  Although more productive slaves were more valuable to slave owners, which might be expected to delay manumission, more productive slaves faced more attractive labor market opportunities outside slavery, which elicited greater effort within slavery in order to buy their way out of slavery.  Further, this paper addresses three important and two emergent literatures: the economics of slavery; the economics of stature; and the economics of complexion.  The results reveal that height, complexion, and sex were the principal determinants of age at manumission""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A more complete conceptual framework for financing of small and medium enterprises,Finance,"""The authors propose a more complete conceptual framework for analysis of credit availability for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  In this framework, lending technologies are the key conduit through which government policies and national financial structures affect credit availability.  They emphasize a causal chain from policy to financial structures which affect the feasibility and profitability of different lending technologies.  These technologies, in turn, have important effects on SME credit availability.  Financial structures include the presence of different financial institution types and the conditions under which they operate.  Lending technologies include several transactions technologies, plus relationship lending.  The authors argue that the framework implicit in most of the literature is oversimplified, neglects key elements of the chain, and often yields misleading conclusions.  A common oversimplification is the treatment of transactions technologies as a homogeneous group, unsuitable for serving informationally opaque SMEs, and a frequent misleading conclusion is that large institutions are disadvantaged in lending to opaque SMEs.

Evaluation of currency regimes the unique role of sudden stops /,Economic theory,"""This paper tackles two established puzzles in international macroeconomics literature.  The first is the lack of systematic difference in the macroeconomic performance across exchange rate regimes.  The second is the absence of a clear empirical relationship between macroeconomic performance and capital-account liberalization.  We suggest that both may appear because empirical methodologies fail to account for a latent economic ""crisis state,"" influenced by exchange-rate and capital account regimes, and to allow the effects of a policy regime on growth to depend on whether the economy is in a crisis-prone latent state.  In practice, we model and estimate the latent state of the economy as a crisis probability.  In the framework we propose, exchange rate and capital market liberalization regimes can have both a direct effect on short-term growth, and an indirect effect on growth that is channelled through their effects on the crisis probability""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Inequality of opportunity and economic development,Finance,"""Just as equality of opportunity becomes an increasingly prominent concept in normative economics, the authors argue that it is also a relevant concept for positive models of the links between distribution and aggregate efficiency.  Persuasive microeconomic evidence suggests that inequalities in wealth, power, and status have efficiency costs.  These variables capture different aspects of people's opportunity sets, for which observed income may be a poor proxy.  One implication is that the cross-country literature on income inequality and growth may have been barking up the wrong tree, and that alternative measures of the relevant distributions are needed.  The authors review some of the detailed microeconomic evidence, and then suggest three research areas where further work is needed. ""--World Bank web site."
Consumption smoothing and the welfare consequences of social insurance in developing economies,Economic theory,"""Studies of risk in developing economies have focused on consumption fluctuations as a measure of the value of insurance.  A common view in the literature is that the welfare costs of risk and benefits of social insurance are small if income shocks do not cause large consumption fluctuations.  We present a simple model showing that this conclusion is incorrect if the consumption path is smooth because individuals are highly risk averse.  Empirical studies find that many households in developing countries rely on inefficient methods to smooth consumption, suggesting that they are indeed quite risk averse.  Hence, social safety nets may be valuable in low-income economies even when consumption is not very sensitive to shocks""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Spatial dimensions of trade liberalization and economic convergence Mexico 1985-2002 /,Finance,"""This paper studies the spatial dimension of growth in Mexico over the past three decades.  The literature on regional economic growth shows a decrease in regional dispersion from 1970 to 1985, and a sharp increase afterward coinciding with the trade liberalization of the Mexican economy.  Using spatial econometric, tools the authors analyze how the process of convergence/divergence has mapped spatially and whether it makes sense to talk about spatial regions in Mexico.  Although the rich North-poor South dichotomy has dominated this phenomenon, interesting patterns emerge.  Namely the distribution of growth after Mexico's post-liberalization seems to be much less associated with distance to the United States than the authors had initially expected.

"""soft"" skills, ""hard"" skills, and the black/white earnings gap","Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper provides both a theoretical and an empirical investigation into the impact of job skill types on the black/white pay differentials. The theoretical analysis derives that the more intensively ""soft""/""hard"" skills are used in an occupation, the greater/smaller the black/white pay differential is there in that occupation. Moreover, in response to the differential pay gaps across jobs requiring different levels of ""soft""/""hard"" skills, blacks are more likely to self-select themselves into the jobs that use ""hard"" skills more intensively, ceteris paribus. Using NLSY data, we find consistent empirical evidence to our theoretical predictions.

"What do we really know about trends in outpatient  medical expenditures for children, 1977 to 1987?",Economic theory,"""This analysis of outpatient medical expenditures for children identifies which children experience a relative decline in medical expenditures between 1977 and 1987.  The paper also evaluates some standard methodologies used in medical demand estimation.  Our semiparametic approach models expenditures simultaneously with the choice of insurance plan and the decision to incur any expenditures.  Children in poor families and Hispanic children witness a decline in expenditures relative to other children.  Children on Medicaid and black children experience stable expenditures over time.  These results imply that the recent Medicaid expansions may not help all children attain good health.  The results are sensitive to assumptions of insurance exogeneity, but are insensitive to the assumptions governing the decision to incur any expenditures.  The general emphasis in the health economics literature on sample selection instead of insurance endogeneity therefore seems misguided""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Regional disparities in the spatial correlation of state income growth,Economic theory,"""This paper presents new evidence of spatial correlation in U.S. state income growth.  We extend the basic spatial econometric model used in the growth literature by allowing spatial correlation in state income growth to vary across geographic regions.  We find positive spatial correlation in income growth rates across neighboring states, but that the strength of this spatial correlation varies considerably by region.  Spatial correlation in income growth is highest for states located in the Northeast and the South.  Our findings have policy implications both at the state and national level, and also suggest that growth models may benefit from incorporating more complex forms of spatial correlation""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Who cares about relative deprivation ?,Finance,"""Theories of relative deprivation predict negative welfare effects when friends and neighbors become better-off.  Other theories point to likely positive benefits.  The authors encompass both views within a single model, which motivates their tests using a survey for Malawi that collected data on satisfaction with life, own economic welfare, and the perceived welfare of friends and neighbors.  Their methods help address likely biases in past tests found in the literature.  In marked contrast to research for industrial countries, the authors find that relative deprivation is generally not a concern for most of their sample, although it does appear to matter to the comparatively well off.  Their results provide a welfarist explanation for the priority given to absolute poverty in poor countries.  The pattern of externalities also suggests that there will be too much poverty and inequality in this economy, even judged solely from the point of view of aggregate efficiency.

What defines 'news' in foreign exchange markets?,Economic theory,"""This paper examines whether the traditional sets of macro surprises, that most of the literature considers, are the only sorts of news that can explain exchange rate movements.  We examine the intra-daily influence of a broad set of news reports, including variables which are not typically considered ""fundamentals"" in the context of standard models of exchange rate determination, and ask whether they too help predict exchange rate behavior.  We also examine whether ""news"" not only impacts exchange rates directly, but also influences exchange rates via order flow (signed trade volume).  Our results indicate that along with the standard fundamentals, both non-fundamental news and order flow matter, suggesting that future models of exchange rate determination ought to include all three types of explanatory variables""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Internet advertising and the generalized second price auction selling billions of dollars worth of keywords /,Economic theory,"""We investigate the ""generalized second price"" auction (GSP), a new mechanism which is used by search engines to sell online advertising that most Internet users encounter daily.  GSP is tailored to its unique environment, and neither the mechanism nor the environment have previously been studied in the mechanism design literature.  Although GSP looks similar to the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, its properties are very different.  In particular, unlike the VCG mechanism, GSP generally does not have an equilibrium in dominant strategies, and truth-telling is not an equilibrium of GSP.  To analyze the properties of GSP in a dynamic environment, we describe the generalized English auction that corresponds to the GSP and show that it has a unique equilibrium.  This is an ex post equilibrium that results in the same payoffs to all players as the dominant strategy equilibrium of VCG""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Foreign portfolio investment, foreign bank lending, and economic growth",Finance,"""In contrast to the empirical literature's focus on foreign direct investment (FDI), this study examines the effects of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and ""other"" foreign investment (OFI) on economic growth using data on 88 countries from 1977 through 2000.  Most measures suggest that FPI has no effect, and some results indicate that OFI has a negative impact on growth that is somewhat mitigated by initial financial and/or legal development.  However, these results are questionable due to possible simultaneity bias.  The empirical analyses also examine whether non-FDI foreign investment affects growth indirectly.  FPI does not correlate positively with macroeconomic volatility, but the results indicate that the negative indirect effect of OFI through macroeconomic volatility comprises a substantial portion of the gross negative effect of OFI on growth""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Long-run supply effects and the elasticities approach to trade,Finance,"""Krugman (1989) argued that differences across countries in estimated income elasticities of import demand are due to omission of an exporter supply effect.  He showed that such an effect can be derived in a theoretical model with economies of scale in production and a taste for variety in consumption.  In his model, countries grow by producing new varieties of goods, and they are able to export these goods without suffering any deterioration in their terms of trade.  This paper analyzes U.S.  import demand from different source countries and finds strong evidence of a supply effect of roughly half the magnitude (0.75) of the income elasticity (1.5).  Price elasticities for the most part are estimated close to -1, which is typical for the literature.  Exclusion of the supply effect leads to overestimation of the income elasticity.  Results based on U.S.  exports to different destinations are less robust, but largely corroborate these findings""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
A theory of the currency denomination of international trade,Finance,"""Nominal rigidities due to menu costs have become a standard element in closed economy macroeconomic modeling.  The ""New Open Economy Macroeconomics"" literature has investigated the implications of nominal rigidities in an open economy context and found that the currency in which prices are set has significant macroeconomic and policy implications.  In this paper we solve for the optimal invoicing choice by integrating this microeconomic decision at the firm level into a general equilibrium open economy model.  Strategic interactions between firms play a critical role in the analysis.  We find that the less competition firms face in foreign markets, as reflected in market share and product differentiation, the more likely they will price in their own currency.  We also show that when a set of countries forms a monetary union, the new currency is likely to be used more extensively in trade than the sum of the currencies it replaces""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Is the corporate loan market globally integrated? a pricing puzzle /,Finance,"""We offer evidence that interest rate spreads on syndicated loans to corporate borrowers are economically significantly smaller in Europe than in the U.S., other things equal.  Differences in borrower, loan and lender characteristics associated with equilibrium mechanisms suggested in the literature do not appear to explain the phenomenon.  Borrowers overwhelmingly issue in their natural home market and bank portfolios display significant home ""bias."" This may explain why pricing discrepancies are not competed away, but the fundamental causes of the discrepancies remain a puzzle.  Thus, important determinants of loan origination market outcomes remain to be identified, home ""bias"" appears to be material for pricing, and corporate financing costs differ in Europe and the U.S""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
What are the right institutions in a globalizing world? and-- can we keep them if we've found them?,Finance,"""Greater trade integration has often been viewed as requiring greater standardization in institutions, without which the benefits of trade do not materialize.  There are many current debates concerning the degree and area of standardization needed and these debates are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  This paper, drawing on both the fiscal federalism and the trade literature, argues that increasing trade integration is consistent with a wide array of institutional choices.  The final outcome, in terms of which institutions have prevailed, has depended substantially on political pressures for standardization and not necessarily on a clear assessment of economic gains.

Identifying vars based on high frequency futures data,Finance,"""Using the prices of federal funds futures contracts, we measure the impact of the surprise component of Federal Reserve policy decisions on the expected future trajectory of interest rates.  We show how this information can be used to identify the effects of a monetary policy shock in a standard monetary policy VAR.  This constitutes an alternative approach to identification that is quite different, and, we would argue, more plausible, than the conventional short-run restrictions.  We find that the usual recursive identification of the model is rejected, but we nevertheless agree with the literature's conclusion that only a small fraction of the variance of output can be attributed to monetary policy shocks""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Evidence uncovered long-term interest rates, monetary policy, and the expectations theory /",Finance,"""A large body of literature has failed to find conclusive evidence that the expectations theory of the term structure holds in U.S. data.  This paper asks more narrowly whether the theory holds conditional on an exogenous change in monetary policy.  We argue that previous work on the expectation theory has failed to sufficiently account for interactions between monetary policy and bond markets in the determination of long and short interest rates.  Using methods that directly account for this interaction, we find strong evidence supporting a term structure channel for policy that is consistent with the expectations theory.  We show that the marginal effect of our consideration for this source of simultaneity bias is significant in uncovering evidence for the theory.  We also discuss previous claims that policy regime changes and short-term interest rate smoothing by the Fed accounts for the theory's unconditional failure in light of our findings""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Fiscal federalism and European integration implications for fiscal and monetary policies /,Finance,"""This paper examines European economic integration in light of standard thinking about fiscal federalism.  We first describe the main features of European integration, analyzing how institutions in the European Union fit the prescriptions of a federal system.  We find that in some areas the European Union has already developed arrangements that fit standard views of fiscal federalism, in other areas there is gradual movement toward prescribed arrangements, and in still other areas the European Union℗s unique historical path may suggest some interesting new departures in the federalism literature.  We try to extract some lessons from this analysis: some recommendations for Europe based on the orthodox principles of fiscal federalism, and some modifications of these orthodox principles based on the European experience""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Common stochastic trends, common cycles, and asymmetry in economic fluctuations",Finance,"""This paper investigates the nature of business cycle asymmetry using a dynamic factor model of output, investment, and consumption.  We first identify a common stochastic trend and a common transitory component by embedding the permanent income hypothesis within a simple growth model.  We then investigate two types of asymmetry commonly identified in U.S.  business cycle dynamics: (1) Infrequent negative permanent shocks, modeled as shifts in the growth rate of the common stochastic trend and (2) infrequent negative transitory shocks, modeled as ""plucking"" deviations from the common stochastic trend.  Tests of marginal significance suggest both types of asymmetry were present in post-war recessions, although the shifts in trend are less severe than the received literature suggests""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Detecting lack of identification in gmm,Finance,"""In the standard linear instrumental variables regression model, it must be assumed that the instruments are correlated with the endogenous variables in order to ensure the consistency and asymptotic normality of the usual instrumental variables estimator.  Indeed, if the instruments are only slightly correlated with the endogenous variables, the conventional Gaussian asymptotic theory may still provide a very poor approximation to the finite sample distribution of the usual instrumental variables estimator.  Because of the crucial role of this identification condition, it is common to test for instrument relevance by a first-stage F-test.  Identification issues also arise in the generalized method of moments model, of which the linear instrumental variables model is a special case.  But I know of no means, in the existing literature, of testing for identification in this model.  This paper proposes a test of the null of underidentification in the generalized method of moments model""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
The determinants of return intentions of Turkish students and professionals residing abroad an empirical investigation /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The study estimates an empirical model of return intentions using a dataset compiled from an internet survey of Turkish professionals and Turkish students residing abroad. In the migration literature, wage differentials are often cited as an important factor explaining skilled migration. The findings of the study suggest, however, that other factors are also important in explaining the non-return of Turkish professionals. Economic instability in Turkey is found to be an important push factor, while work experience in Turkey also increases non-return. In the student sample, higher salaries offered in the host country and lifestyle preferences, including a more organized environment in the host country, increase the probability of not-returning. For both groups, the analysis also points to the importance of prior intentions and the role of the family in the decision to return to Turkey or stay overseas""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Is the collective model of labor supply useful for tax policy analysis? a simulation exercise,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The literature on household behavior contains hardly any empirical research on the within-household distributional effect of tax-benefit policies. We simulate this effect in the framework of a collective model of labor supply when shifting from a joint to an individual taxation system in France. We show that the net-of-tax relative earning potential of the wife is a significant determinant of intrahousehold negotiation but with very low elasticity. Consequently, the labor supply responses to the reform are entirely driven by the traditional substitution and income effects as in a unitary model. For some households only, the reform alters the intrahousehold distribution in a way that tends to change normative conclusions. A sensitivity analysis shows that the collective model would be required if the tax reform was both radical and of extended scope""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Education and inequality in Greece,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In the public discourse, education is usually considered as the main vehicle for the promotion of social equality and social mobility.

Inequities are evident at all levels of the education system; especially as regards access to the most rewarding level, that is, university education. Many facets of the inequities observed in the labour market are associated with education, while education appears to be the single most important factor that shapes the overall distribution of income and influences the probability of poverty.

Multifrequency news and stock returns,Economic theory,"""Recent research documents that aggregate stock prices are driven by shocks with persistence levels ranging from daily intervals to several decades.  Building on these insights, we introduce a parsimonious equilibrium model in which regime-shifts of heterogeneous durations affect the volatility of dividend news.  We estimate tightly parameterized specifications with up to 256 discrete states on daily U.S.  equity returns.  The multifrequency equilibrium has significantly higher likelihood than the classic Campbell and Hentschel (1992) specification, while generating volatility feedback effects 6 to 12 times larger.  We show in an extension that Bayesian learning about stochastic volatility is faster for bad states than good states, providing a novel source of endogenous skewness that complements the ""uncertainty"" channel considered in previous literature (e.g., Veronesi, 1999).  Furthermore, signal precision induces a tradeoff between skewness and kurtosis, and economies with intermediate investor information best match the data""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The incidence of pollution control policies,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews theoretical and empirical literature on the household distribution of the costs and benefits of pollution control policies, and ways of integrating distributional issues into environmental cost/benefit analysis.  Most studies find that policy costs fall disproportionately on poorer groups, though this is less pronounced when lifetime income is used, and policies affect prices of inputs used pervasively across the economy.  The policy instrument itself is also critical; freely allocated emission permits may hurt the poor the most, as they transfer income to shareholders via scarcity rents created by higher prices, while emissions taxes offer opportunities for progressive revenue recycling.  And although low-income households appear to bear a disproportionate share of environmental risks, policies that reduce risks are not always progressive, for example, they may alter property values in ways that benefit the wealthy.  The review concludes by noting a number of areas where future research is badly needed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

While our research design is very similar to studies for various other countries, we find very different estimates of the returns.  Most estimates in the literature indicate returns in the range of 10 to 15 percent.  We find no return to compulsory schooling in Germany in terms of higher wages.  We investigate whether this is due to labor market institutions or the existence of the apprenticeship training system in Germany, but find no evidence for these explanations.  We conjecture that the result might be due to the fact that the basic skills most relevant for the labor market are learned earlier in Germany than in other countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Our results suggest that the choice of an estimation procedure has a substantial impact on the parameter estimates of the migration function. Out-of-sample forecasting results indicate the following: (i) the standard fixed effects estimators clearly outperforms the pooled OLS estimator, (ii) both the fixed effects estimators and the hierarchical Bayes estimator exhibit the superior forecast performance, (iii) the fixed effects estimators outperform GMM and other instrumental variables estimators, (iv) forecasting performance of heterogenous estimators is mediocre in our data set""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

A detailed graphical analysis of campaign contributions by the agricultural PACs indicates that although there are very many PACs, in most sectors the majority of contributions are made by very few PACs.  Econometric analysis reveals that lobbying spending by agricultural PACs is positively associated with the use of nontariff barriers and specific tariffs by the United States.  There is a strong association between the average U.S.  tariff on goods that benefit from U.S.  export subsidies and lobbying spending.

The empirical analysis is based on the NLSY97, which allows us to study six types of STW programs, including job shadowing, mentoring, coop, school enterprises, tech prep, and internships/apprenticeships. For men there is quite a bit of evidence that STW program participation is particularly advantageous for those in the forgotten half. For these men, specifically, mentoring and coop programs increase post-secondary education, and coop, school enterprise, and internship/apprenticeship programs boost employment and decrease idleness after leaving high school. There is less evidence that STW programs are particularly beneficial for women in the forgotten half, although internship/apprenticeship programs do lead to positive earnings effects concentrated among these women""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

More specifically, we analyze whether changes in Costa Rica's complex institution of multiple minimum wages in the 1980s and 1990s acted as a countervailing force to the unequalizing effect of globalization. Using annual data on workers from the 1987-1997 household surveys, it is shown that changes in the legal minimum wages did indeed have an effect on wage inequality and that these changes would not have been captured using the simple interpretation of minimum wages found in much of the literature""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Another look at sticky prices and output persistence,Economic theory,"""Price rigidity is the key mechanism for propagating business cycles in traditional Keynesian theory.  Yet the New Keynesian literature has failed to show that sticky prices by themselves can effectively propagate business cycles in general equilibrium.  We show that price rigidity in fact can (by itself) give rise to a strong propagation mechanism of the business cycle in standard New Keynesian models, provided that investment is also subject to a cash-in-advance constraint.  In particular, we show that reasonable price stickiness can generate highly persistent, hump-shaped movements in output, investment and employment in response to either monetary or non-monetary shocks, even if investment is only partially cash-in-advance constrained.  Hence, whether or not price rigidity is responsible for output persistence (and the business cycle in general) may not be a theoretical question, but an empirical one""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Are the dynamic linkages between the macroeconomy and asset prices time-varying?,Economic theory,"""We estimate a number of multivariate regime switching VAR models on a long monthly data set for eight variables that include excess stock and bond returns, the real T-bill yield, predictors used in the finance literature (default spread and the dividend yield), and three macroeconomic variables (inflation, real industrial production growth, and a measure of real money growth).  Heteroskedasticity may be accounted for by making the covariance matrix a function of the regime.  We find evidence of four regimes and of time-varying covariances.  We provide evidence that the best in-sample fit is provided by a four state model in which the VAR(1) component fails to be regime-dependent.  We interpret this as evidence that the dynamic linkages between financial markets and the macroeconomy have been stable over time.  We show that the four-state model can be helpful in forecasting applications and to provide one-step ahead predicted Sharpe ratios""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
"Product quality, linder, and the direction of trade",Economic theory,"""A substantial amount of theoretical work predicts that quality plays an important role as a determinant of the global patterns of bilateral trade.  This paper develops an empirical framework to estimate the empirical relevance of this prediction.  In particular, it identifies the effect of quality operating on the demand side through the relationship between per capita income and aggregate demand for quality.  The model yields predictions for bilateral flows at the sectoral level, and is estimated using cross-sectional data for bilateral trade among 60 countries in 1995.  The empirical results confirm the theoretical prediction: rich countries tend to import relatively more from countries that produce high quality goods.  The paper also shows that a severe aggregation bias explains the failure of the literature so far to find consistent empirical support for the ""Linder hypothesis"", the conjectured corollary to the first theory relating product quality and the direction of trade""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Emphasis is put on the linkages between the current inflation environment and that of the gold standard period.

Child mental health and human capital accumulation the case of ADHD /,Economic theory,"""We examine U.S.  and Canadian children with symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the most common child mental health problem.  ADHD increases the probability of delinquency and grade repetition, reduces future reading and mathematics scores, and increases the probability of special education.  The estimated effects are remarkably similar in the two countries, and are robust to many specification changes.Moreover, even moderate symptoms have large negative effects relative to the effects of poor physical health.  The probability of treatment increases with income in the U.S., but not in Canada.  However, in models of outcomes, interactions between income and ADHD scores are statistically insignificant in the U.S.  (except for delinquency), while in Canada these interactions indicate that higher income is protective.

Inflation targeting and debt lessons from Brazil /,Economic theory,"""Studying the recent experience of Brazil the paper explains how default risk is at the centre of the mechanism through which an emerging market central bank that targets inflation might lose control of inflation--in other words of the mechanism through which the economy might move from a regime of 'monetary dominance' to one of 'fiscal dominance'.  The literature, from Sargent and Wallace (1981) to the modern fiscal theory of the price level has discussed how an unsustainable fiscal policy may hinder the effectiveness of monetary policy, to the point that an increase in interest rates can have a perverse effect on inflation.  We show that the presence of default risk reinforces the possibility that a vicious circle might arise, making the fiscal constraint on monetary policy more stringent""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
There is a risk-return tradeoff after all,Economic theory,"""This paper studies the ICAPM intertemporal relation between the conditional mean and the conditional variance of the aggregate stock market return.  We introduce a new estimator that forecasts monthly variance with past daily squared returns - the Mixed Data Sampling (or MIDAS) approach.  Using MIDAS, we find that there is a significantly positive relation between risk and return in the stock market.  This finding is robust in subsamples, to asymmetric specifications of the variance process, and to controlling for variables associated with the business cycle.  We compare the MIDAS results with tests of the ICAPM based on alternative conditional variance specifications and explain the conflicting results in the literature.  Finally, we offer new insights about the dynamics of conditional variance""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Chaotic interest rate rules expanded version /,Economic theory,"""A growing empirical and theoretical literature argues in favor of specifying monetary policy in the form of Taylor-type interest rate feedback rules.  That is, rules whereby the nominal interest rate is set as an increasing function of inflation with a slope greater than one around an intended inflation target.  This paper shows that such rules can easily lead to chaotic dynamics.  The result is obtained for feedback rules that depend on contemporaneous or expected future inflation.  The existence of chaotic dynamics is established analytically and numerically in the context of calibrated economies.  The battery of fiscal policies that has recently been advocated for avoiding global indeterminacy induced by Taylor-type interest-rate rules (such as liquidity traps) are shown to be unlikely to provide a remedy for the complex dynamics characterized in this paper""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Systemic crises and growth,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we document the fact that countries that have experienced occasional financial crises have, on average, grown faster than countries with stable financial conditions.  We measure the incidence of crisis with the skewness of credit growth, and find that it has a robust negative effect on GDP growth.  This link coexists with the negative link between variance and growth typically found in the literature.  To explain the link between crises and growth we present a model where weak institutions lead to severe financial constraints and low growth.  Financial liberalization policies that facilitate risk-taking increase leverage and investment.  This leads to higher growth, but also to a greater incidence of crises.  Conditions are established under which the costs of crises are outweighed by the benefits of higher growth""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Futures prices as risk-adjusted forecasts of monetary policy,Economic theory,"""Many researchers have used federal funds futures rates as measures of financial markets' expectations of future monetary policy.  However, to the extent that federal funds futures reflect risk premia, these measures require some adjustment to account for these premia.  In this paper, we document that excess returns on federal funds futures have been positive on average and strongly countercyclical.  In particular, excess returns are surprisingly well predicted by macroeconomic indicators such as employment growth and financial business-cycle indicators such as Treasury yield spreads and corporate bond spreads.  Excess returns on eurodollar futures display similar patterns.  We document that simply ignoring these risk premia has important consequences for the expected future path of monetary policy.  We also show that risk premia matter for some futures-based measures of monetary policy surprises used in the literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Measuring market integration foreign exchange arbitrage and the gold standard, 1879-1913 /",Economic theory,"""A major question in the literature on the classical gold standard concerns the efficiency of international arbitrage.  Authors have examined efficiency by looking at the spread of the gold points, gold point violations, the flow of gold, or by tests of various asset market criteria, including speculative efficiency and interest arbitrage.  These studies have suffered from many limitations, both methodological and empirical.  We offer a new methodology for measuring market integration based on nonlinear theoretical models and threshold autoregressions.  We also compile a new, high-frequency series of continuous daily data from 1879 to 1913.  We can derive reasonable econometric estimates of the implied gold points and price dynamics.  The changes in these measures over time provide an insight into the evolution of market integration""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
VAR estimation and forecasting when data are subject to revision,Economic theory,"""Conventional VAR estimation and forecasting ignores the fact that economic data are often subject to revision many months or years after their initial release. This paper shows how VAR analysis can be modified to account for such revisions. The proposed approach assumes that government statistical releases are efficient with a finite lag. It takes no stand on whether earlier revisions are ""noise"" or ""news."" The technique is illustrated using data on employment and the unemployment rate, real GDP and the unemployment rate, and real GDP and the GDP/consumption ratio. In each case, the proposed procedure outperforms conventional VAR analysis and the more-restrictive methods for handling the data-revision problem that are found in the existing literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site."
How big are potential welfare gains from international sharing?,Economic theory,"""There is extensive evidence that the degree of risksharing accomplished by international financial markets is low.  Some have argued that this is the result of small potential benefits from risksharing.  The gains from riskpooling that have been reported in the literature range from negligible to enormous.  This paper documents to what extent the results are sensitive to the parameterization of preferences, and assumptions about the stochastic process and measurement of the endowment.  We find that for realistic assumptions about the underlying factors, the potential gains from risksharing are quite sizable.  For OECD countries they are equivalent to increases in tradables consumption in the range of 1.1 to 3.5 percent for a 50 year horizon, and 2.5 to 7.4 percent for a 100 year horizon""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
"Explaining inequality the world round cohort size, Kuznets curves, and openness /",Economic theory,"""Klaus Deininger and Lyn Squire have recently produced an inequality data base for a panel of countries from the 1960s to the 1990s.  We use these data to decompose the sources of inequality into three central parts: the demographic or cohort size effect; the so-called Kuznets Curve or demand effects; and the commitment to globalization or policy effects.  We also control for education supply, the so-called natural resource curse and other variables suggested by the literature.  While the Kuznets Curve comes out of hiding when the inequality relationship is conditioned by the other two, cohort size seems to be the most important force at work.  We resolve the apparent conflict between this macro finding on cohort size and the contrary implications of recent research based on micro data""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
A multi-country approach to factor-proportions trade and trade costs,Economic theory,"""Classic trade questions are reconsidered by generalizing a factor-proportions model to multiple countries, multi-stage production, and country-specific trade costs.  We derive patterns of production specialization and trade for a matrix of countries that differ in relative endowments (columns) and trade costs (rows).  We demonstrate how the ability to fragment production and/or a proportional change in all countries' trade costs alters these patterns.  Production specialization and the volume of trade are higher with fragmentation for most countries but interestingly, for a large block of countries, these variables fall following fragmentation.  Countries with moderate trade costs engage in market-oriented assembly, while those with lower trade costs engage in export-platform production.  These two cases correspond to the concepts of horizontal and vertical affiliate production in the literature on multinational enterprises.  Increases in specialization and the volume of trade accelerate as trade costs go to zero with and without fragmentation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Water, water, everywhere municipal finance and water supply in American cities /",Economic theory,"""The construction of municipal water systems was a major event in the history of American cities--bringing relief from disease, providing resources to combat fires, attracting business investment, and promoting development generally.  Although the first large-scale municipal water system in the United States was completed in 1801, many American cities lacked waterworks until the turn of the twentieth century.  This paper investigates the reason for the century-long delay and the subsequent frenzy of waterworks construction from 1890 through the 1920s.  We propose an explanation that emphasizes the development of local public finance.  Specifically, we highlight the importance of municipal bond market growth as a facilitator of debt finance.  We argue that this explanation is superior to others put forward in the literature, including disease knowledge, the presence of externalities, municipal population density, natural monopoly, contracting difficulties, corruption costs, and growth in the supply of civil engineers""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Using home maintenance and repairs to smooth variable earnings,Economic theory,"""Recent research indicates that the marked increase in U.S.  income inequality over the last twenty-five years has not been matched by a similar increase in consumption inequality.  This paper examines the role of saving/dissaving in a house as a vehicle for consumption smoothing.  Data from the American Housing Survey show that expenditures on home maintenance and repairs are economically significant, amounting to roughly $1,750 per household each year.  This figure is comparable to the labor literature estimates that put households' average annual transitory income variance at about $2,200.  Our calculations show a significant elasticity of maintenance and repair expenditures to transitory income shocks.  The elasticities are higher for less well educated households, which are more likely to be liquidity constrained than their better educated counterparts""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Optimal inflation persistence Ramsey taxation with capital and habits /,Finance,"""Ramsey models of fiscal and monetary policy with perfectly-competitive product markets and a fixed supply of capital predict highly volatile inflation with no serial correlation.  In this paper, we show that an otherwise-standard Ramsey model that incorporates capital accumulation and habit persistence predicts highly persistent inflation.  The result depends on increases in either the ability to smooth consumption or the preference for doing so.  The effect operates through the Fisher relationship: a smoother profile of consumption implies a more persistent real interest rate, which in turn implies persistent optimal inflation.  Our work complements a recent strand of the Ramsey literature based on models with nominal rigidities.  In these models, inflation volatility is lower but continues to exhibit very little persistence.  We quantify the effects of habit and capital on inflation persistence and also relate our findings to recent work on optimal fiscal policy with incomplete markets""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Pitfalls of a state-dominated financial system the case of China /,Economic theory,"""State-owned financial institutions have been proposed as a way to address market failure, but the recent literature has also highlighted their pathological problems.  This paper studies the case of China for pitfalls of a state-dominated financial system, including possible segmentation of the internal capital market due to local government interference and mis-allocation of capital.  Even without formal legal prohibition to capital movement across regions, we find that capital mobility within China is low.  Furthermore, to the extent some capital moves around the country, the government (as opposed to the private sector) tends to allocate capital systematically away from more productive regions toward less productive ones.  In this context, a smaller role of the government in the financial sector might increase economic efficiency and the rate of economic growth""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The co-movement between cotton and polyester prices,Finance,"""The authors examine the price linkages among polyester (the dominant chemical fiber), cotton (the dominant natural fiber), and crude oil (the dominant energy commodity), based on monthly data between 1980 and 2002.  The modeling framework incorporates several aspects of the unit root econometrics literature.  They find that: a) There is strong co-movement between cotton and polyester prices, well above the co-movement observed between these two prices and prices of other primary commodities.  b) Crude oil prices have a stronger effect on polyester prices compared with cotton prices.  c) Price shocks originating in the polyester market are transmitted at much higher speed to the cotton market than vice-versa.

As we have acknowledge, our ability to answer confidently many of the issues raised here questions is likely to increase as the open source movement itself grows and evolves.  At the same time, it is heartening to us how much of open source activities can be understood within existing economic frameworks, despite the presence of claims to the contrary.

Are perks purely managerial excess?,Economic theory,"""Why do some firms tend to offer executives a variety of perks while others offer none at all? A widespread view in the corporate finance literature is that executive perks are a form of agency or private benefit and a way for managers to misappropriate some of the surplus the firm generates.  According to this view, firms with plenty of free cash flow that operate in industries with limited investment prospects should typically offer perks.  The theory also suggests that firms that are subject to more external monitoring should have fewer perks.  Overall, the evidence for the private benefits explanation is, at best, mixed.  We do, however, find evidence that perks are offered most in situations where they are likely to enhance managerial productivity.  This suggests that a view of perks that sees them purely as managerial excess is incorrect""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Soft information, hard sell the role of soft information in the pricing of intellectual property /",Economic theory,"""There is a growing literature on the differential impact of soft' vs.  hard' information on organizational structure and behavior.  This study is an attempt to empirically quantify the value of soft information, using a data-base on the market for screenplays.  Script quality is difficult to estimate without subjective evaluation.  Therefore soft information should be an integral part of the pricing of these intellectual assets.  In our empirical analysis, we find that hard information' (reputation) variables as well as soft information' proxies are priced.  Screenplays with high soft information content are priced significantly lower than high concept' harder information'- type scripts.  We also follow the screenplays to production, and find that buyers seem to be able to forecast the success of a script, paying more for screenplays resulting in more successful films.  In other words, high concept' (harder information) screenplays sell for more and result in more successful movies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Patent licensing revisited heterogeneous firms and product differentiation /,Economic theory,"""In this paper we study the optimal licensing agreement between a patentholder of a costreducing innovation and firms that have heterogeneous uses for the new technology.

We extend the competition environment among the licensees beyond the Cournot/Bertrand models considered by the previous literature to a framework with differentiated products.  We also assume that potential licensees have private information about the usefulness of the new technology.  We characterize two purposes the optimal licensing contract serves to the patentholder: separation of the licensees and competition softening in the downstream market.  We also describe how the optimal contract changes with the degree of product differentiation""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Empirical estimates for environmental policy making in a second-best setting,Economic theory,"""This study estimates parameters necessary to calculate the optimal second-best gasoline tax, most notably the cross-price elasticity between gasoline and leisure.  Prior work indicates that in a second-best setting with distortionary income taxes, both the cost of environmental regulation and the optimal environmental tax rate depend crucially on the cross-price elasticity between a polluting good and leisure.  However, no prior study on second-best environmental regulation has estimated this elasticity.  Using household data, we find that gasoline is a relative complement to leisure, and thus that the optimal gasoline tax is significantly higher than marginal damages the opposite of the result suggested by the prior literature.  Following this approach to estimate cross-price elasticities with leisure for other major polluting goods could strongly influence estimates of optimal environmental taxes""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Household vs. personal accounts of the U.S. Labor Market, 1965-2000",Economic theory,"""The empirical labor supply literature includes some simple aggregate studies, and some individual-level studies explicitly accounting for heterogeneity and the discrete choice, but sometimes leaving open the ultimately aggregate questions that motivated the study.  As a middle ground, we construct household-based measures of labor supply by within-household aggregating answers to the usual weeks and hours worked questionnaire items.  Household (H) measures are substantially different than the more familiar person (P) measures: H employment rates are relatively higher, with little trend, and relatively little fluctuations.  From the H point of view, essentially all aggregate hours trends and fluctuations can be attributed to changes on the intensive' margin and not the extensive' margin a characterization that is opposite of that derived from P measures.  The cross-H distribution of hours is richer, and less spiked, than the cross-P distribution.  Labor supply is more wage elastic from an H point of view""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Business cycles the role of energy prices /,Economic theory,"""Oil price shocks have figured prominently in U.S. business cycles since the end of World War II--although the relationship seems to have weakened during the 1990s. In addition the economy appears to respond asymmetrically to oil price shocks, rising oil prices hurt economic activity more than falling oil prices help it. This section of the Encyclopedia of Energy sorts through an extensive economics literature that relates oil price shocks to aggregate economic activity. It examines how oil price shocks create business cycles, why they seem to have a disproportionate effect on economic activity, why the economy responds asymmetrically to oil prices, and why the relationship between oil prices and economic activity may have weakened. It also addresses the issue of developing energy policy to mitigate the economic effects of oil price shocks""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site."
Do we need CAPM for capital budgeting?,Economic theory,"""A key input to the capital budgeting process is the cost of capital.  Financial managers most often use the CAPM for estimating the cost of capital for which they need to know the market risk premium.  Textbooks advocate using the historical value for the U.S.  equity premium as the market risk premium.  The CAPM as a model has been seriously challenged in the academic literature.  In addition recent research indicates that the true market risk premium might have been as low as half the historical U.S.  equity premium during the last two decades.  If business finance courses have been teaching the use of the wrong model along with wrong inputs for twenty years, why has no one complained?

Optimal interest rate policy in a small open economy,Economic theory,"""Using an optimizing model we derive the optimal monetary and exchange rate policy for a small stochastic open economy with imperfect competition and short run price rigidity.  The optimal monetary policy has an exact closed-form solution and is obtained using the utility function of the representative home agent as welfare criterion.  The optimal policy depends on the source of stochastic disturbances affecting the economy, much as in the literature pioneered by Poole (1970).  Optimal monetary policy reacts to domestic and foreign disturbances.  If the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is less than one, as is likely to be the case empirically, the optimal exchange rate policy implies a dirty float: interest rate shocks from abroad are met partially by adjusting home interest rates, and partially by allowing the exchange rate to move.  This optimal pattern may help rationalize the observed fear of floating""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Charity auctions a field experimental investigation /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Auctions are a popular way to raise money for charities, but relatively little is known, either theoretically or empirically, about the properties of charity auctions. The small theoretical literature suggests that the all-pay auction should garner more money than winner-pay auctions. We conduct field experiments to test which sealed bid format, first price, second price or all-pay raises the most money. Our experiment suggests that both the all-pay and second price formats are dominated by the first price auction. Our design also allows us to identify differential participation as the source of the difference between existing theory and the field. To conclude, we show that a model of charity auctions augmented by an endogenous participation decision predicts the revenue ordering that we see in the field""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Regional income inequality in selected large countries,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Income inequality can be measured at different levels of aggregation such as global, continental, international and national levels.

The empirical results reported are based on the second half of the 20th century. The countries considered here cover large transition, developing and industrialised countries.

Do workers really benefit from their social networks?,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper provides a simple matching model in which unemployed workers and employers in large firms can be matched together through social networks or through more ""formal"" methods of search. We show that networks do not necessarily add new externalities and that some results previously obtained in the literature are questionable. Nevertheless, social networks can, in some case, substitute for labor market and this crowding-out effect may be socially costly. We show that a policy increasing the number of workers embedded in the social networks can increase the unemployment rate and decrease workers welfare. Since it is mostly the firms which benefit from larger social networks, transfers from the firms to the workers are necessary to make larger access to the social networks efficient""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Outlier aversion in evaluating performance evidence from figure skating /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The quality of subjective performance evaluation is dependent on the incentive structures faced by evaluators, in particular on how they are monitored and themselves evaluated. Figure skating competitions provide a unique opportunity to study subjective evaluation. This paper develops and tests a simple model of what I call ""outlier aversion bias"" in which subjective evaluators avoid submitting outlying judgments. We find significant evidence for the existence of outlier aversion. Individual judges within a game manipulate scores to achieve a targeted level of agreement with the other judges. Furthermore, a natural experiment shows that the dispersion of scores across judges depends upon the type of judge-assessment system and its implication for outlier aversion. Agreement may not be a good criterion for the validity of an evaluation system, contradicting the industrial psychology and personnel management literature""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Ethnic networks and international trade,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""There is a well-established high quality literature on the role of networks, particularly ethnic networks, in international trade. Ethnic networks are a way of overcoming informal barriers (information costs, risk and uncertainty) to trade by building trust and substituting for the difficulty of enforcing contracts internationally. The networks we are interested in are those that form between migrants and natives in the host country and between migrants and their home country. Ethnic networks exist when assimilation is not complete. We consider the struggle of migrants to assimilate and, at the same time, the struggle of the local population to prevent such assimilation. These activities affect trade possibilities. Moreover, we show that it may well be in the interest of migrants who specialize in trade to, at some point in time, turn from investing in assimilation activities and instead invest in anti-assimilation activities in order to preserve immigrants' preferences for home country goods""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Does monitoring decrease work effort? the complementarity between agency and crowding-out theories /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Agency theory assumes that tighter monitoring by the principal should motivate the agent to raise his effort level whereas the ""crowding-out"" literature suggests that it may reduce the overall work effort. These two assertions are not necessarily contradictory provided that the nature of the employment relationship is taken into account (Frey, 1993). Based upon a realtask laboratory experiment, our results show that principals are not trustful enough to refrain from monitoring the agents, and most of the agents react to the disciplining effect of monitoring. However we find also some evidence that intrinsic motivation is crowded out when monitoring is above a certain threshold. We identify that both interpersonal principal/agent links and concerns for the distribution of output payoff are important for the emergence of this crowding out effect""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Inequalities and their measurement,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper is a review of the recent advances in the measurement of inequality. Inequality can have several dimensions.

Non-income inequality includes inequality in skills, education, opportunities, happiness, health, wealth, and others. The direct and indirect effects of inequality in non-income factors on earnings and health are discussed. Results from review of the literature suggest relationship between inequality in income and non-income dimensions.

The economics of workaholism we should not have worked on this paper /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A large literature examines the addictive properties of such behaviors as smoking, drinking alcohol and eating. We argue that for some people addictive behavior may apply to a much more central aspect of economic life: working. Workaholism is subject to the same concerns about the individual as other addictions, is more likely to be a problem of higher-income individuals, and can, under conditions of jointness in the workplace or the household, generate negative spillovers onto individuals around the workaholic. Using the Retirement History Survey and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find evidence that is consistent with the idea that high-income, highly educated people suffer from workaholism with regard to retiring, in that they are more likely to postpone earlier plans for retirement. The theory and evidence suggest that optimal policy involves a more progressive tax system than in the absence of workaholism""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Low-wage employment in Portugal a mixed logit approach /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In this paper, we examine the determinants of low-wage employment in Portugal. For this purpose, we use a data file of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) for the years 1998 and 1999. In order to take into account unobserved heterogeneity in the data, a random-parameter logit model is used to analyse the probability of a worker receiving a low wage. The results indicate that the consideration that the effects of the explanatory variables are the same across all individuals, such as is assumed in most of the literature may be misleading. From the policy perspective, this implies that the use of a single instrument in order to combat low-wage employment is inappropriate to satisfy the whole population. In view of this, policies tailored by clusters would be more appropriate""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
How has financial modernization affected corporate customers?,Economic theory,"""Previous studies of the announcement effects of relaxing administrative and legislative restraints show that signal events leading up to the enactment of the Financial Services Modernization Act (FSMA) increased the prices of financial-institution stocks.  An unsettled question is whether the gains observed for these stocks arise from projected increases in efficiency or from reductions in customer bargaining power.  This paper documents that some of the value increase came at the expense of potential and actual customers.  The stock prices of credit-constrained customers declined during FSMA event windows and experienced significant increases in beta in the wake of its enactment.  These findings reinforce evidence in the literature on bank mergers that large-bank consolidation is unfavorably affecting the availability of credit for capital-constrained firms""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Do foreign firms really pay higher wages? evidence from different estimators /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""We contribute to the literature on Foreign Direct Investment and labour markets by examining wage differentials between domestic and foreign firms, drawing on a large Portuguese matched employer-employee panel. Using OLS, the foreign-firm premium is large and significantly positive but falls substantially when firm and worker controls are added. Moreover, the premium also does not vary monotonically with foreign control, it increases along the wage distribution and it is generally insignificant when using propensity score matching. Finally, using differences-in-differences, we find lower wage growth for workers in domestic firms that are acquired by foreign investors, a result that holds when combining differences-in-differences and propensity score matching. Overall, our evidence suggests that the commonly-documented OLS premium cannot be interpreted as a causal impact""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Rent sharing before and after the wage bill,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Many biases plague the estimation of rent sharing in labour markets. Using a Portuguese matched employer-employee panel, these biases are addressed in this paper in three complementary ways: (1) Controlling directly for the fact that firms that share more rents will, ceteris paribus, have lower net-of-wages profits. (2) Instrumenting profits via interactions between the exchange rate and the share of exports in firms' total sales. (3) Considering firm or firm/worker spell fixed effects and highlighting the role of downward wage rigidity. These approaches clarify conflicting findings in the literature and result, in our preferred specification, in a Lester range of pay dispersion of 56%, also shown to be robust to a number of competitive interpretations""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The case for industrial policy a critical survey /,Finance,"""What are the underlying rationales for industrial policy? Does empirical evidence support the use of industrial policy for correcting market failures that plague the process of industrialization? To address these questions, the authors provide a critical survey of the analytical literature on industrial policy.  They also review some recent industry successes and argue that only a limited role was played by public interventions.  Moreover, the recent ascendance of international industrial networks, which dominate the sectors in which less developed countries have in the past had considerable success, implies a further limitation on the potential role of industrial policies as traditionally understood.  Overall, there appears to be little empirical support for an activist government policy even though market failures exist that can, in principle, justify the use of industrial policy.

The incentive effects of higher education subsidies on student effort,Economic theory,"""This paper uses a game-theoretic model to analyze the disincentive effects of low-tuition policies on student effort.  The model of parent and student responses to tuition subsidies is then calibrated using information from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the High School and Beyond Sophomore Cohort: 1980-92.  I find that although subsidizing tuition increases enrollment rates, it reduces student effort.  This follows from the fact that a high-subsidy, low-tuition policy causes an increase in the percentage of less able and less highly motivated college graduates.  Additionally--and potentially more important--all students, even the more highly motivated ones, respond to lower tuition levels by decreasing their effort levels.  This study adds to the literature on the enrollment effects of low-tuition policies by demonstrating how high-subsidy, low-tuition policies have both disincentive effects on students' study time and adverse effects on human capital accumulation""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Testing a Roy model with productivity spillovers evidence from the treatment of heart attacks /,Economic theory,"""Productivity spillovers are often cited as a reason for geographic specialization in production.  A large literature in medicine documents specialization across areas in the use of surgical treatments, which is unrelated to patient outcomes.  We show that a simple Roy model of patient treatment choice with productivity spillovers can generate these facts.  Our model predicts that high-use areas will have higher returns to surgery, better outcomes among patients most appropriate for surgery, and worse outcomes among patients least appropriate for surgery.  We find strong empirical support for these and other predictions of the model, and decisively reject alternative explanations commonly proposed to explain geographic variation in medical care""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
What shapes attitudes toward paying taxes? evidence from multicultural European countries,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Considerable evidence suggests that enforcement efforts cannot fully explain the high degree of tax compliance. To resolve this puzzle of tax compliance several researchers have argued that citizens' attitudes toward paying taxes defined as tax morale helps to explain the high degree of tax compliance. However, most studies have treated tax morale as a black box without discussing which factors shape it. Additionally, the tax compliance literature provides little empirical research that investigates attitudes toward paying taxes in Europe. Thus, this paper is unique in its examination of citizen tax morale within three multicultural European countries, Switzerland, Belgium and Spain, a choice that allows far more detailed examination of the impact of culture and institutions using datasets from the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
When are ghettos bad? lessons from immigrant segregation in the united states,Economic theory,"""Recent literature on the relationship between ethnic or racial segregation and outcomes has failed to produce a consensus view of the role of ghettos; some studies suggest that residence in an enclave is beneficial, some reach the opposite conclusion, and still others imply that any relationship is small.  This paper presents new evidence on this relationship using data on first-generation immigrants in the United States.  Using average group characteristics as instruments for segregation, controlling for individual characteristics and both metropolitan area and country-of-origin fixed effects, we estimate impacts of residential concentration that vary with group human capital levels.  Residential concentration can be beneficial, but primarily for more educated groups.  The mean impact of residential concentration varies across measures, which may illuminate some of the causal mechanisms relating segregation to outcomes""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The effects of migration on child health in Mexico,Finance,"""The authors investigate the impact of international migration on child health outcomes in rural Mexico using a nationally representative demographic survey.  They use historic migration networks as instruments for current household migration to the United States in order to correct for the possible endogeneity of migrant status.  They find that children in migrant households have lower rates of infant mortality and higher birth-weights.  The authors study the channels through which migration may affect health outcomes and find evidence that migration raises health knowledge in addition to the direct effect on wealth.

These results provide a broader and more nuanced view of the health consequences of migration than is offered by the existing literature. ""--World Bank web site."
"""For one more year with you"" changes in compulsory schooling, education and the distribution of wages in Europe","Industries, Land use, Labor","""Using data from 12 European countries and the variation across countries and over time in the changes of minimum school leaving age, we study the effects of the quantity of education on the distribution of earnings. We find that compulsory school reforms significantly affect educational attainment, especially among individuals belonging to the lowest quantile of the distribution of ability. Contrary to previous findings in the relevant literature, we find that additional education reduces wage inequality below median income and increases it above median income. There is also evidence in our data that education and ability are complements in the production of human capital and earnings. While these results support an elitist education policy -- more education to the brightest, they also suggest that investing in the less fortunate but bright could payoff both on efficiency and on equity grounds""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Managerial skill acquisition and the theory of economic development,Economic theory,"""Micro level studies in developing countries suggest managerial skills play a key role in the adoption of modern technologies.  The human resources literature suggests that managerial skills are difficult to codify and learn formally, but instead tend to be learned on the job.  In this paper we present a model of the interactive process between on-the-job managerial skill acquisition and the adoption of modern technology.  The environment considered is one where all learning possibilities are internalized in the market, and where managers are complementary inputs to non-managerial workers.  The paper illustrates why some countries may adopt modern technologies while others stay backwards.  The paper also explains why managers may not want to migrate from rich countries to poor countries as would be needed to generate income convergence""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The abcs of charitable solicitation,Economic theory,"""A substantial experimental literature suggests that a personal solicitation is an effective way to induce people to make charitable donations.  We examine whether this result generalizes to a non-experimental setting.  Specifically, we estimate the effect of a marginal personal solicitation using observational data on alumni giving at an anonymous research university, which we refer to as Anon U.  At Anon U, volunteers use lists provided by the Development Office to telephone classmates and solicit them for donations.  The names on these lists are always in alphabetical order.  The volunteers who do the soliciting often run out of time before they reach the end of their lists.  These observations suggest a simple strategy for testing whether personal solicitation matters, viz., examine whether alumni with names toward the end of the alphabet are less likely to give than alumni with names toward the beginning, ceteris paribus.  If so, then a marginal personal solicitation matters.  Our main finding is that location in the alphabet -- and hence, a personal solicitation -- has a strong effect on probability of making a gift.  A rough estimate of the elasticity of the probability of giving with respect to the probability of receiving a personal solicitation is 0.15.  However, there is no statistically discernible effect on the amount given, conditional on donating.  We also find that women respond more strongly to a personal solicitation than men.  This is consistent with a robust result in the psychology literature, that women find it more difficult than men to refuse requests that they perceive as being legitimate""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"How do workplace smoking laws work? quasi-experimental evidence from local laws in ontario, canada /",Economic theory,"""There are very large literatures in public health and economics on the effects of workplace smoking bans, with most studies relying on cross-sectional variation.  We provide new quasi-experimental evidence on the effects of workplace bans by using the differential timing of adoption of over 100 very strong local smoking by-laws in Ontario, Canada over the period 1997-2004.  We employ restricted-use repeated cross section geocoded outcome data to estimate reduced form models that control for demographic characteristics, year fixed effects, and county fixed effects.  We first show that the effects of the local laws on actual worksite smoking policy (i.e.  the ""first stage"") were not uniform; specifically, local laws were only effective at increasing ban presence among blue collar workers.  Among blue collar workers, adoption of a local by-law significantly reduced the fraction of worksites without any smoking restrictions (i.e.  where smoking is allowed anywhere at work) by over half.  The differential effect of local policies also improved health outcomes: we find that adoption of a local by-law significantly reduced SHS exposure among blue collar workers by 25-30 percent, and we confirm that workplace smoking laws reduce smoking.  We find plausibly smaller and insignificant estimates for white collar and sales/service workers -- the vast majority of whom worked in workplaces with privately initiated smoking bans well before local by-laws were adopted.  Overall our findings advance the literature by confirming that workplace smoking bans reduce smoking, documenting the underlying mechanisms through which local smoking by-laws improve health outcomes, and showing that the effects of these laws are strongly heterogeneous with respect to occupation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The impact of group diversity on performance and knowledge spillover -- an experiment in a college classroom,Economic theory,"""An important yet under-explored question in the teamwork literature concerns how group characteristics affect productivity.  Within a given teamwork setting, it is not obvious how group member diversity affects the performance of the individual and the group.  The group may gain from knowledge transfer and sharing while it may be crippled by communication and coordination problems that are prevalent in heterogeneous groups.  In this study, we combine class performance data from an undergraduate management class with students' personal records to explore diversity and knowledge spillover effects.  A major advantage of our dataset is the exogenous assignment of groups, which rules out the troublesome yet common self selection issue in team literature.  Our results indicate that male dominant groups performed worse both in group work and in individually taken exams than female dominant and equally mixed gender groups after controlling for other group characteristics.  Individual members from a group with more diversity in age and gender scored higher in exams. However, we did not find any significance of a group's racial composition over group and individual performances.  Another novel aspect of this natural experiment is that each group chooses their own group contract form members of ""autonomous"" groups receive equal grade for their group work while those in ""democratic"" groups can adopt differentiated point allocation, thus providing a proper mechanism to punish free riders.  Our estimation results show a significant correlation between the choice of a democratic contract and the group and individual performance.  To address the endogeneity problem in groups contract choices, we use a maximum likelihood treatment effect model and found that the democratic group contract has a positive and significant effect on group performance""-National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Beyond bmi the value of more accurate measures of fatness and obesity in social science research /,Economic theory,"""Virtually all social science research related to obesity uses body mass index (BMI), usually calculated using self-reported values of weight and height, or clinical weight classifications based on BMI.  Yet there is wide agreement in the medical literature that such measures are seriously flawed because they do not distinguish fat from fat-free mass such as muscle and bone.  Here we evaluate more accurate measures of fatness (total body fat, percent body fat, and waist circumference) that have greater theoretical support in the medical literature.  We provide conversion formulas based on NHANES data so that researchers can calculate the estimated values of these more accurate measures of fatness using the self-reported weight and height available in many social science datasets.To demonstrate the benefits of these alternative measures of fatness, we show that using them significantly impacts who is classified as obese.  For example, when the more accurate measures of fatness are used, the gap in obesity between white and African American men increases substantially, with white men significantly more likely to be obese.  In addition, the gap in obesity between African American and white women is cut in half (with African American women still significantly more likely to be obese).  As an example of the value of fatness in predicting social science outcomes, we show that while BMI is positively correlated with the probability of employment disability in the PSID, when body mass is divided into its components, fatness is positively correlated with disability while fat-free mass (such as muscle) is negatively correlated with disability""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Gross worker flows in the presence of informal labor markets the Mexican experience 1987-2002 /,Finance,"""This paper applies recent advances in the study of labor market dynamics to a representative developing country with a large informal or unregulated sector, Mexico.  It studies quarterly gross flows of workers over a 15-year period that includes two recoveries and recessions, including the celebrated 1995 Tequila crisis.  It finds, first, that the formal or modern salaried sector shows the same procyclical job finding rate and mildly countercyclical separation behavior identified in the recent U.S.  literature, and relative wage rigidity, both consistent with Shimer (2005a) and Hall (2005).  The unregulated informal sector, however, shows reasonable acyclicality in the job finding rate coupled with sharp countercyclical movements in the job separation rate, consistent with standard small firm dynamics and Davis and Haltiwanger (1992 and 1999).  This interaction of regulatory coverage and firm sizes, and patterns of gross worker flows thus sheds suggestive light on the roots of countercyclical job finding behavior in the U.S.  literature.  Second, the patterns of worker transitions between formality and informality correspond to the job-to-job dynamics observed in the United States and not to the traditional idea of informality constituting the inferior sector of a segmented market.  That said, the countercyclical job finding in the formal sector combined with the acyclical job finding in informality does lead to the latter absorbing relatively more labor during downturns.  Third, aggregate employment dynamics vary across the Tequila crisis and the later 2001 slowdown, suggesting that not only the composition of employment, but the nature of the shocks is important to understanding how the labor market adjusts.&lt;BR&gt; ""--World Bank web site."
Interpreting the evidence on life cycle skill formation,Economic theory,"""This paper presents economic models of child development that capture the essence of recent findings from the empirical literature on skill formation.  The goal of this essay is to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting the evidence from a vast empirical literature, for guiding the next generation of empirical studies, and for formulating policy.  Central to our analysis is the concept that childhood has more than one stage.  We formalize the concepts of self-productivity and complementarity of human capital investments and use them to explain the evidence on skill formation.  Together, they explain why skill begets skill through a multiplier process.  Skill formation is a life cycle process.  It starts in the womb and goes on throughout life.  Families play a role in this process that is far more important than the role of schools.  There are multiple skills and multiple abilities that are important for adult success.  Abilities are both inherited and created, and the traditional debate about nature versus nurture is scientifically obsolete.  Human capital investment exhibits both self-productivity and complementarity.  Skill attainment at one stage of the life cycle raises skill attainment at later stages of the life cycle (self-productivity).  Early investment facilitates the productivity of later investment (complementarity).  Early investments are not productive if they are not followed up by later investments (another aspect of complementarity).  This complementarity explains why there is no equity-efficiency trade-off.  for early investment.  The returns to investing early in the life cycle are high.  Remediation of inadequate early investments is difficult and very costly as a consequence of both self-productivity and complementarity""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Why do banks promise to pay par on demand?,Economic theory,"""We survey the theories of why banks promise to pay par on demand and examine evidence about the conditions under which banks have promised to pay the par value of deposits and banknotes on demand when holding only fractional reserves.  The theoretical literature can be broadly divided into four strands: liquidity provision, asymmetric information, legal restrictions, and a medium of exchange.  We assume that it is not zero cost to make a promise to redeem a liability at par value on demand.  If so, then the conditions in the theories that result in par redemption are possible explanations of why banks promise to pay par on demand.  If the explanation based on customers' demand for liquidity is correct, payment of deposits at par will be promised when banks hold assets that are illiquid in the short run.  If the asymmetric-information explanation based on the difficulty of valuing assets is correct, the marketability of banks' assets determines whether banks promise to pay par.  If the legal restrictions explanation of par redemption is correct, banks will not promise to pay par if they are not required to do so.  If the transaction explanation is correct, banks will promise to pay par value only if the deposits are used in transactions.  After the survey of the theoretical literature, we examine the history of banking in several countries in different eras: fourth-century Athens, medieval Italy, Japan, and free banking and money market mutual funds in the United States.  We find that all of the theories can explain some of the observed banking arrangements, and none explain all of them""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Competitive implications of cross-border banking,Finance,"""This paper reviews the recent literature on cross-border banking, with a focus on policy implications.  Cross-border banking has increased sharply in recent decades, particularly in the form of entry, and has affected the development of financial systems, access to financial services, and stability.  Reviewing the empirical literature, the author finds much, although not uniform, evidence that cross-border banking supports the development of an efficient and stable financial system that offers a wide access to quality financial services at low cost.  But as better financial systems have more cross-border banking, the relationship between cross-border banking and competitiveness has to be carefully judged.  While developing countries have some special conditions, provided a minimum degree of oversight is in place, they experience effects similar to industrial countries.  There are some questions, though, on the effects of cross-border banking on lending based on softer information and on stability.  Relevant experiences from capital markets show that the degree of cross-border financial activities can affect local market sustainability and there can be path dependency when opening up to cross-border competition.  Reviewing the fast changing landscape of financial services provision, the author argues that cross-border banking highlights the increased importance of competition policy in financial services provision.  This competition policy cannot be traditional, institutional based, but will need to resemble that used in other network industries.  Furthermore, with globalization accelerating, competition policy will need to be global, supported by greater cross-border institutional collaboration and using the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) process and the disciplines of the World Trade Organization.  GATS can be of special value to developing countries as it provides a binding, pro-competition framework that has proven more difficult to establish otherwise. ""--World Bank web site."
Evaluation of four tax reforms in the United States labor supply and welfare effects for single mothers /,Economic theory,"""A large literature evaluating the welfare effects of taxation has examined the role of the labor supply elasticity, and has shown that the estimated welfare effects are highly sensitive to its size.  A common feature of this literature is its exclusive focus on hours worked and the associated marginal tax rate.  An emerging consensus among public finance and labor economists, however, is that labor supply is more responsive along the extensive margin (participation) than along the intensive margin (hours worked).  To understand the implications of the participation decision for the welfare analysis of tax reform, this paper embeds the extensive margin in an explicit welfare theoretic framework.  It is shown that the participation effect on welfare is created by a different tax wedge than the marginal-tax wedge relevant for hours of work.  This difference is due to non-linearities and discontinuities in tax-transfer schemes, features that are particularly important for the welfare evaluation of tax reforms affecting the bottom of the income distribution.  We apply our framework to examine the labor supply and welfare effects for single mothers in the United States following four tax acts passed in 1986, 1990, 1993, and 2001.  Our simulations show that each of the four tax acts reduced the tax burden on low-income single mothers, and created substantial welfare gains.  We note three features of the welfare effects.  First, we find that welfare gains are almost exclusively concentrated along the extensive margin of labor supply.  Second, welfare effects along the extensive margin tend to dominate those along the intensive margin, even when the two labor supply elasticities are of similar size.  This occurs because the welfare effect on each margin is created by a different tax wedge.  Finally, ignoring the composition of the labor supply elasticity may reverse the sign of the welfare effect.  In the welfare evaluation of tax reform, we conclude that the composition of the total labor supply elasticity is as important as its size""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Small-scale private service providers of water supply and electricity a review of incidence, structure, pricing, and operating characteristics",Finance,"""This paper summarizes the key findings and conclusions of a literature review of small-scale private service providers (SPSPs) of water supply and electricity conducted over a six-month period in 2003.  It draws on more than 400 documents-including journals, articles, reports, case studies and project reports-which have been disaggregated and referenced in a publicly available database.  SPSPs appear most prevalent in countries with low coverage levels, ineffective public utilities that provide inadequate or partial services, and remote, difficult-to-access regions.  SPSPs are especially prevalent in post-conflict countries and others with weak or failed states.  Of the countries for which evidence of SPSPs was available, at least half fall into this category.  SPSP provision of networked services appears to be significantly higher for electricity than for water supply.  Most SPSPs identified through the literature are single-purpose entities established for the express purpose of delivering water supply or electricity.  SPSPs take a variety of organizational forms, both for-profit and non-profit.  As such, they are established for a variety of reasons, including: to meet consumer demand, respond to crises, or as part of larger business ventures.  The technology used may extend upstream from distribution services to the means for producing or generating water supply or electricity, so capital needs vary accordingly.  The majority of SPSPs have fewer than 50 employees and usually fewer than 10.  A lack of affordable financing is a constraint for most SPSPs, which fund investments mainly through their own earnings and savings, loans from friends and family, and money borrowed from formal and informal lenders.

Controversies about the rise of American inequality a survey /,Economic theory,"""This paper provides a comprehensive survey of seven aspects of rising inequality that are usually discussed separately: changes in labor's share of income; inequality at the bottom of the income distribution, including labor mobility; skill-biased technical change; inequality among high incomes; consumption inequality; geographical inequality; and international differences in the income distribution, particularly at the top.  We conclude that changes in labor's share play no role in rising inequality of labor income; by one measure labor's income share was almost the same in 2007 as in 1950.  Within the bottom 90 percent as documented by CPS data, movements in the 50-10 ratio are consistent with a role of decreased union density for men and of a decrease in the real minimum wage for women, particularly in 1980-86.  There is little evidence on the effects of imports, and an ambiguous literature on immigration which implies a small overall impact on the wages of the average native American, a significant downward effect on high-school dropouts, and potentially a large impact on previous immigrants working in occupations in which immigrants specialize.The literature on skill-biased technical change (SBTC) has been valuably enriched by a finer grid of skills, switching from a two-dimension to a three- or five-dimensional breakdown of skills.  We endorse the three-way ""polarization"" hypothesis that seems a plausible way of explaining differentials in wage changes and also in outsourcing.To explain increased skewness at the top, we introduce a three-way distinction between market-driven superstars where audience magnification allows a performance to reach one or ten million people, a second market-driven segment consisting of occupations like lawyers and investment bankers, and a third segment consisting of top corporate officers.  Our review of the CEO debate places equal emphasis on the market in showering capital gains through stock options and an arbitrary management power hypothesis based on numerous non-market aspects of executive pay.Data on consumption inequality are too fragile to reach firm conclusions.  We introduce two new issues, disparities in the growth of price indexes and also of life expectancy between the rich and the poor.  We conclude with a perspective on international differences that blends institutional and market-driven explanations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Heuristic thinking and limited attention in the car market,Economic theory,"""Can heuristic information processing affect important product markets? We explore whether the tendency to focus on the left-most digit of a number affects how used car buyers incorporate odometer values in their purchase decisions.  Analyzing over 22 million wholesale used-car transactions, we find substantial evidence of this left-digit bias; there are large and discontinuous drops in sale prices at 10,000-mile thresholds in odometer mileage, along with smaller drops at 1,000-mile thresholds.  We obtain estimates for the inattention parameter in a simple model of this left-digit bias.  We also investigate whether this heuristic behavior is primarily attributable to the final used-car customers or the used-car salesmen who buy cars in the wholesale market.  The evidence is most consistent with partial inattention by final customers.  We discuss the significance of these results for the literature on inattention and point to other market settings where this type of heuristic thinking may be important.  Our results suggest that information-processing heuristics may be important even in markets with large stakes and where information is easy to observe""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The economics of risky health behaviors,Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  Risky health behaviors such as smoking, drinking alcohol, drug use, unprotected sex, and poor diets and sedentary lifestyles (leading to obesity) are a major source of preventable deaths.  This chapter overviews the theoretical frameworks for, and empirical evidence on, the economics of risky health behaviors.  It describes traditional economic approaches emphasizing utility maximization that, under certain assumptions, result in Pareto-optimal outcomes and a limited role for policy interventions.  It also details nontraditional models (e.g.  involving hyperbolic time discounting or bounded rationality) that even without market imperfections can result in suboptimal outcomes for which government intervention has greater potential to increase social welfare.  The chapter summarizes the literature on the consequences of risky health behaviors for economic outcomes such as medical care costs, educational attainment, employment, wages, and crime.  It also reviews the research on policies and strategies with the potential to modify risky health behaviors, such as taxes or subsidies, cash incentives, restrictions on purchase and use, providing information and restricting advertising.  The chapter concludes with suggestions for future research""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Charitable giving when altruism and similarity are linked,Economic theory,"""This paper presents a model in which anonymous charitable donations are rationalized by two human tendencies drawn from the psychology literature.  The first is people's disproportionate disposition to help those they agree with while the second is the dependence of peoples' self-esteem on the extent to which they perceive that others agree with them.  Government spending crowds out the charity that ensues from these forces only modestly.  Moreover, people's donations tend to rise when others donate.  In some equilibria of the model, poor people give little because they expect donations to come mainly from richer individuals.  In others, donations by poor individuals constitute a large fraction of donations and this raises the incentive for poor people to donate.  The model predicts that, under some circumstances, charities with identical objectives can differ by obtaining funds from distinct donor groups.  The model then provides an interpretation for situations in which the number of charities rises while total donations are stagnant""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
With a little help from my (random) friends success and failure in post-business school entrepreneurship /,Economic theory,"""To what extent do peers affect our occupational choices? This question has been of particular interest in the context of entrepreneurship and policies to create a favorable environment for entry.  Such influences, however, are hard to identify empirically.  We exploit the assignment of students into business school sections that have varying numbers of classmates with prior entrepreneurial experience.  We find that the presence of entrepreneurial peers strongly predicts subsequent entrepreneurship rates of students without an entrepreneurial background, but in a more complex way than the literature has previously suggested: A higher share of entrepreneurial peers leads to lower rather than higher subsequent rates of entrepreneurship.  However, the decrease in entrepreneurship is entirely driven by a significant reduction in unsuccessful entrepreneurial ventures.  The effect on the rate of successful post-MBA entrepreneurs, instead, is insignificantly positive.  In addition, sections with few prior entrepreneurs have a considerably higher variance in their rates of unsuccessful entrepreneurs.  The results are consistent with intra-section learning, where the close ties between section-mates lead to insights about the merits of business plans""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The real effects of financial markets,Economic theory,"""A large amount of activity in the financial sector occurs in secondary financial markets, where securities are traded among investors without capital flowing to firms.  The stock market is the archetypal example, which in most developed economies captures a lot of attention and resources.  Is the stock market just a side show or does it affect real economic activity? In this article, we discuss the potential real effects of financial markets that stem from the informational role of market prices.  We review the theoretical literature and show that accounting for the feedback effect from market prices to the real economy significantly changes our understanding of the price formation process, the informativeness of the price, and speculators' trading behavior.  We make two main points.  First, we argue that a new definition of price efficiency is needed to account for the extent to which prices reflect information useful for the efficiency of real decisions (rather than the extent to which they forecast future cash flows).  Second, incorporating the feedback effect into models of financial markets can explain various market phenomena that otherwise seem puzzling.  Finally, we review empirical evidence on the real effects of secondary financial markets""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Costly blackouts? measuring productivity and environmental effects of electricity shortages /,Economic theory,"""In many countries, unreliable inputs, particularly those lacking storage, can significantly limit a firm's productivity.  In the case of an increasing frequency of blackouts, a firm may change factor shares in a number of ways.  It may decide to self generate electricity, to purchase intermediate goods that it used to produce directly, or to improve its technical efficiency.  We examine how industrial firms responded to China's severe power shortages in the early 2000s.  Fast-growing demand coupled with regulated electricity prices led to blackouts that varied in degree over location and time.  Our data consist of annual observations from 1999 to 2004 for approximately 32,000 energy-intensive, enterprises from all industries.  We estimate the losses in productivity due to factor-neutral and factor-biased effects of electricity scarcity.  Our results suggest that enterprises re-optimize among factors in response to electricity scarcity by shifting from energy (both electric and non-electric sources) into materials---a shift from ""make"" to ""buy."" These effects are strongest for firms in textiles, timber, chemicals, and metals.  Contrary to the literature, we do not find evidence of an increase in self generation.  Finally, we find that these productivity changes, while costly to firms, led to small reductions in carbon emissions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"International trade in durable goods understanding volatility, cyclicality, and elasticities /",Economic theory,"""Data for OECD countries document: 1.  imports and exports are about three times as volatile as GDP; 2.  imports and exports are pro-cyclical, and positively correlated with each other; 3.  net exports are counter-cyclical.  Standard models fail to replicate the behavior of imports and exports, though they can match net exports relatively well.  Inspired by the fact that a large fraction of international trade is in durable goods, we propose a two-country two-sector model, in which durable goods are traded across countries.  Our model can match the business cycle statistics on the volatility and comovement of the imports and exports relatively well.  In addition, the model with trade in durables helps to understand the empirical regularity noted in the trade literature: home and foreign goods are highly substitutable in the long run, but the short run elasticity of substitution is low.  We note that durable consumption also has implications for the appropriate measures of consumption and prices to assess risk-sharing opportunities, as in the empirical work on the Backus-Smith puzzle.  The fact that our model can match data better in multiple dimensions suggests that trade in durable goods may be an important element in open-economy macro models""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Understanding international price differences using barcode data,Economic theory,"""The empirical literature in international finance has produced three key results about international price deviations: borders give rise to flagrant violations of the law of one price, distance matters enormously for understanding these deviations, and most papers find that convergence rates back to purchasing power parity are inconsistent with the evidence of micro studies on nominal price stickiness.  The data underlying these results are mostly comprised of price indexes and price surveys of goods that may not be identical internationally.  In this paper, we revisit these three stylized facts using massive amounts of US and Canadian data that share a common barcode classification.  We find that none of these three main stylized facts survive.  We use our barcode level data to replicate prior work and explain what assumptions caused researchers to find different results from those we find in this paper.  Overall, our work is supportive of simple pricing models where the degree of market segmentation across the border is similar to that within borders""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The allocative cost of price ceilings in the U.S. residential market for natural gas,Economic theory,"""A direct consequence of imposing a ceiling on the price of a good for which secondary markets do not exist, is that, when there is excess demand, the good will not be allocated to the buyers who value it the most.  The resulting allocative cost has been discussed in the literature as a potentially important component of the total welfare loss from price ceilings, but its practical importance has yet to be established empirically.  In this paper, we address this question using data for the U.S.  residential market for natural gas which was subject to price ceilings during 1954-1989.  This market is well suited for such an empirical analysis and natural gas price ceilings affected millions of households.  Using a household-level, discrete-continuous model of natural gas demand, we estimate that the allocative cost in the U.S.  residential market for natural gas averaged $4.6 billion annually since the 1950s, effectively tripling previous estimates of the net welfare loss to U.S.  consumers.  We quantify the evolution of this allocative cost and its geographical distribution during the post-war period, and we highlight implications of our analysis for the regulation of other markets""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Return migration as a channel of brain gain,Economic theory,"""Recent theoretical and empirical studies have emphasized the fact that the prospect of international migration increases the expected returns to skills in poor countries, linking the possibility of migrating (brain drain) with incentives to higher education (brain gain).  If emigration is uncertain and some of the highly educated remain, such a channel may, at least in part, counterbalance the negative effects of brain drain.  Moreover, recent empirical evidence seems to show that temporary migration is widespread among highly skilled migrants (such as Eastern Europeans in Western Europe and Asians in the U.S.).  This paper develops a simple tractable overlapping generations model that provides an economic rationale for return migration and which predicts who will migrate and who will return among agents with heterogeneous abilities.  We use parameter values from the literature and the data on return migration to simulate the model and quantify the effects of increased openness on human capital and wages of the sending countries.  We find that, for plausible values of the parameters, the return migration channel is very important and combined with the incentive channel reverses the brain drain into significant brain gain for the sending country""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Macroeconomics and ARCH,Economic theory,"""Although ARCH-related models have proven quite popular in finance, they are less frequently used in macroeconomic applications.  In part this may be because macroeconomists are usually more concerned about characterizing the conditional mean rather than the conditional variance of a time series.  This paper argues that even if one's interest is in the conditional mean, correctly modeling the conditional variance can still be quite important, for two reasons.  First, OLS standard errors can be quite misleading, with a ""spurious regression"" possibility in which a true null hypothesis is asymptotically rejected with probability one.  Second, the inference about the conditional mean can be inappropriately influenced by outliers and high-variance episodes if one has not incorporated the conditional variance directly into the estimation of the mean, and infinite relative efficiency gains may be possible.  The practical relevance of these concerns is illustrated with two empirical examples from the macroeconomics literature, the first looking at market expectations of future changes in Federal Reserve policy, and the second looking at changes over time in the Fed's adherence to a Taylor Rule""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Influence, information overload, and information technology in health care",Economic theory,"""We investigate whether information technology can help physicians more efficiently acquire new knowledge in a clinical environment characterized by information overload.  Our analysis makes use of data from a randomized trial as well as a theoretical model of the influence that information technology has on the acquisition of new medical knowledge.  Although the theoretical framework we develop is conventionally microeconomic, the model highlights the non-market and non-pecuniary influence activities that have been emphasized in the sociological literature on technology diffusion.  We report three findings.  First, empirical evidence and theoretical reasoning suggests that computer based decision support will speed the diffusion of new medical knowledge when physicians are coping with information overload.  Secondly, spillover effects will likely lead to ""underinvestment"" in this decision support technology.  Third, alternative financing strategies common to new information technology, such as the use of marketing dollars to pay for the decision support systems, may lead to undesirable outcomes if physician information overload is sufficiently severe and if there is significant ambiguity in how best to respond to the clinical issues identified by the computer""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Forecast targeting as a monetary policy strategy policy rules in practice /,Economic theory,"""Forecast targeting is an innovation in central banking that represents an important step toward more rule-based policymaking, even if it is not an attempt to follow a policy rule of any of the types that have received primary attention in the theoretical literature on optimal monetary policy.  This paper discusses the extent to which forecast targeting can be considered an example of a policy rule, and the conditions under which it would represent a desirable rule, with a view to suggesting improvements in the approaches currently used by forecast-targeting central banks.  Particular attention is given to the intertemporal consistency of forecast-targeting procedures, the assumptions about future policy that should be used in constructing the forecasts used in such procedures, the horizon with which the target criterion should be concerned, the relevance of forecasts other than the inflation forecast, and the degree of robustness of a desirable target criterion for monetary policy to changing circumstances""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How do agricultural policy restrictions to global trade and welfare differ across commodities ?,Finance,"""For decades the world's agricultural markets have been highly distorted by national government policies, but very differently for different commodities.  Hence a weighted average across countries of nominal rates of assistance or consumer tax equivalents for a product can be misleading as an indicator of the trade or welfare effects of policies affecting that product's global market.  This is especially the case when some countries tax and others subsidize its production or consumption.  This article develops a new set of more-satisfactory indicators for that purpose, drawing on the recent literature on trade restrictiveness indexes.  It then exploits a global agricultural distortions database recently compiled by the World Bank to generate the first set of estimates of those two indicators for each of 28 key agricultural commodities from 1960 to 2004, based on a sample of 75 countries that together account for more than three-quarters of the world's production of those agricultural commodities.  These reveal the considerable extent of reforms in agricultural policies of developing as well as high-income countries over the past two decades. ""--World Bank web site."
Mainstreaming climate adaptation into development assistance in Mozambique institutional barriers and opportunities /,Finance,"""Based on a literature review and expert interviews, this paper analyzes the most important climate impacts on development goals and explores relevant institutions in the context of mainstreaming climate adaptation into development assistance in Mozambique.  Climate variability and change can significantly hinder progress toward attaining the Millennium Development Goals and poverty aggravates the country's climate vulnerability.  Because Mozambique is one of the major recipients of official development assistance in the world, there is a clear interest in ensuring that the risks of climate impacts are incorporated into the country's development investments.  A screening of donor activities at the sub-national level shows that a high share of development assistance is invested in climate-sensitive sectors, partly in areas that are particularly exposed to droughts, floods, and cyclones.  The authors find that Mozambique has a supportive legislative environment and donors have a high awareness of climate risks.  However, limited individual, organizational, networking, and financial capacity constrain mainstreaming initiatives.  Given strong limitations at the national level, bilateral and multilateral donors can play a key role in fostering institutional capacity in Mozambique. ""--World Bank web site."
"Aggregate economic shocks, child schooling and child health",Finance,"""Do aggregate economic shocks, such as those caused by macroeconomic crises or droughts, reduce child human capital? The answer to this question has important implications for public policy.  If shocks reduce investments in children, they may transmit poverty from one generation to the next.  This paper uses a simple framework to analyze the effects of aggregate economic shocks on child schooling and health.  It shows that the expected effects are ambiguous, because of a tension between income and substitution effects.  The paper then reviews the recent empirical literature on the subject.  In richer countries, like the United States, child health and education outcomes are counter-cyclical: they improve during recessions.  In poorer countries, mostly in Africa and low-income Asia, the outcomes are pro-cyclical: infant mortality rises, and school enrollment and nutrition fall during recessions.  In the middle-income countries of Latin America, the picture is more nuanced: health outcomes are generally pro-cyclical, and education outcomes counter-cyclical.  Each of these findings is consistent with the simple conceptual framework.  The paper discusses possible implications for expenditure allocation. ""--World Bank web site."
The Taylor rule and forecast intervals for exchange rates,Finance,"""This paper attacks the Meese-Rogoff puzzle from a different perspective: out-of-sample interval forecasting.  Most studies in the literature focus on point forecasts.  In this paper, we apply Robust Semiparametric (RS) interval forecasting to a group of Taylor rule models.  Forecast intervals for twelve OECD exchange rates are generated and modified tests of Giacomini and White (2006) are conducted to compare the performance of Taylor rule models and the random walk.  Our contribution is twofold.  First, we find that in general, Taylor rule models generate tighter forecast intervals than the random walk, given that their intervals cover out-of-sample exchange rate realizations equally well.  This result is more pronounced at longer horizons.  Our results suggest a connection between exchange rates and economic fundamentals: economic variables contain information useful in forecasting the distributions of exchange rates.  The benchmark Taylor rule model is also found to perform better than the monetary and PPP models.  Second, the inference framework proposed in this paper for forecast-interval evaluation can be applied in a broader context, such as inflation forecasting, not just to the models and interval forecasting methods used in this paper""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Tax smoothing in frictional labor markets,Finance,"""We re-examine the optimality of tax smoothing from the point of view of frictional labor markets.  Our central result is that whether or not this cornerstone optimal fiscal policy prescription carries over to an environment with labor market frictions depends crucially on the cyclical nature of labor force participation.  If the participation rate is exogenous at business-cycle frequencies -- as is typically assumed in the literature -- we show it is not optimal to smooth tax rates on labor income in the face of business-cycle shocks.  However, if households do optimize at the participation margin, then tax-smoothing is optimal despite the presence of matching frictions.  To understand these results, we develop a concept of general-equilibrium efficiency in search-based environments, which builds on existing (partial-equilibrium) search-efficiency conditions.  Using this concept, we develop a notion of search-based labor-market wedges that allows us to trace the source of the sharply-contrasting fiscal policy prescriptions to the value of adjusting participation rates.  Our results demonstrate that policy prescriptions can be very sensitive to the cyclical nature of labor-force participation in search-based environments""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Border prices and retail prices,Finance,"""We analyze retail prices and at-the-dock (import) prices of specific items in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) CPI and IPP databases, using both databases simultaneously to identify items that are identical in description at the dock and when sold at retail.  This identification allows us to measure the distribution wedge associated with bringing traded goods from the point of entry into the United States to their retail outlet.  We find that overall U.S.  distribution wedges are 50-70%, around 10 to 20 percentage points higher than that reported in the literature.  We discuss the implications of this for measuring the size of the ""pure"" tradeables sector, exchange rate pass-through, and real exchange rate determination.  We find that distribution wedges are very stable over time but there is considerable variation across items.  There is some variation across the country of origin for the imported item, for our major trading partners, but not as much as the cross-item variation.  We also investigate the determinants of distribution wedges, finding that wedges do not vary systematically with exchange rates, but are related to other features of the micro data""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
The global networks of multinational firms,Economic theory,"""In this paper we characterize the topology of global multinational networks and examine the macro and micro patterns of multinational activity.  We construct indices of network density at both pairwise industry and establishment level and measure agglomeration in a global and continuous metric space.  These indices exhibit distinct advantages compared to traditional measures of agglomeration including the independence on the level of geographic aggregation.  Estimating the indices using a new worldwide establishment dataset, we investigate both the significance and causes of multinational firm co-agglomeration.  In contrast to the conventional emphasis of the literature on the role of input-output linkages, we assess the effect of various agglomeration economies.  We find that, relative to counterfactuals, multinationals with greater factor-market externalities, knowledge spillovers, and vertical linkages exhibit significant co-agglomeration.  The importance of these factors differs across headquarters, subsidiary, and employment networks, but knowledge spillovers and capital-market externalities, two traditionally under-emphasized forces, exert consistently strong effects.  Within each macro network, there is a large heterogeneity across subsidiaries.  Subsidiaries with greater size and higher productivity attract significantly more agglomeration than their counterfactuals and become the hubs of the network""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The (dis)saving behavior of the aged in Japan,Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  In this paper, I survey the previous literature on the saving behavior of the aged in Japan and then present some survey data on the saving behavior of the aged in Japan that became available recently.  To summarize the main findings of this paper, virtually all previous studies as well as the newly available data I analyze find that the retired aged dissave and that even the working aged dissave, at least at advanced ages.  Moreover, there has been a sharp increase in the dissaving of the retired aged since 2000, with the increase being due primarily to reductions in social security benefits, increases in consumption expenditures, and increases in taxes and social insurance premiums.  These findings are consistent with the life-cycle model and suggest that this model is highly applicable (and becoming increasingly applicable over time) in the case of Japan""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Measuring discrimination in education,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we illustrate a methodology to measure discrimination in educational contexts.  In India, we ran an exam competition through which children compete for a large financial prize.  We recruited teachers to grade the exams.  We then randomly assigned child ""characteristics"" (age, gender, and caste) to the cover sheets of the exams to ensure that there is no systematic relationship between the characteristics observed by the teachers and the quality of the exams.  We find that teachers give exams that are assigned to be lower caste scores that are about 0.03 to 0.09 standard deviations lower than exams that are assigned to be high caste.  The effect is small relative to the real differences in scores between the high and lower caste children.  Low-performing, low caste children and top-performing females tend to lose out the most due to discrimination.  Interestingly, we find that the discrimination against low caste students is driven by low caste teachers, while teachers who belong to higher caste groups do not appear to discriminate at all.  This result runs counter to the previous literature, which tends to find that individuals discriminate in favor of members of their own groups""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Incomplete information, higher-order beliefs and price inertia",Economic theory,"""This paper investigates who incomplete information impacts the response of prices to nominal shocks.  Our baseline model is a variant of the Calvo model in which firms observe the underlying nominal shocks with noise.  In this model, the response of prices is pinned down by three parameters: the precision of available information about the nominal shock; the frequency of price adjustment; and the degree of strategic complementarity in pricing decisions.  This result synthesizes the broader lessons of the pertinent literature.  We next highlight that his synthesis provides only a partial view of the role or incomplete information.  In general, the precision of information does not pin down the response of higher-order beliefs.  Therefore, once cannot quantify the degree of price inertia without additional information about the dynamics of higher-order beliefs, or the agents' forecasts of inflation.  We highlight the distinct role of higher-order beliefs with three extensions of our baseline model, all of which break the tight connection between the precision of information and higher-order beliefs featured in previous work""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Do energy prices respond to U.S. macroeconomic news? a test of the hypothesis of predetermined energy prices,Finance,"""Models that treat innovations to the price of energy as predetermined with respect to U.S.  macroeconomic aggregates are widely used in the literature.  For example, it is common to order energy prices first in recursively identified VAR models of the transmission of energy price shocks.  Since exactly identifying assumptions are inherently untestable, this approach in practice has required an act of faith in the empirical plausibility of the delay restriction used for identification.  An alternative view that would invalidate such models is that energy prices respond instantaneously to macroeconomic news, implying that energy prices should be ordered last in recursively identified VAR models.  In this paper, we propose a formal test of the identifying assumption that energy prices are predetermined with respect to U.S.  macroeconomic aggregates.  Our test is based on regressing cumulative changes in daily energy prices on daily news from U.S.  macroeconomic data releases.  Using a wide range of macroeconomic news, we find no compelling evidence of feedback at daily or monthly horizons, contradicting the view that energy prices respond instantaneously to macroeconomic news and supporting the use of delay restrictions for identification""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Decentralization, economic development, and growth in Turkish provinces",Finance,"""There have been important developments in the decentralization of the government structure in Turkey since the early 1980s.  This paper examines economic development and growth in Turkish provinces.  Although there is a rich literature on the economic effects of government decentralization from both developed and developing countries, these effects have not been examined widely in the context of Turkish local governments.  The authors first describe changes since the early 1980s and recent reform efforts.  They then provide an empirical analysis of the effects of decentralization in Turkish provinces using cross-sectional and panel data approaches.  The panel dataset consists of 67 provinces from 1976 to 2001.  The analysis examines whether variations in local decentralization across these provinces and across time have had a significant impact on economic development and growth in those provinces.  The findings suggest a weak negative economic effect of decentralization through a number of municipalities per capita.  However, the findings do not show any significant impact from the creation of new provinces by separation from the existing ones. ""--World Bank web site."
HIV and sexual behavior change why not Africa? /,Economic theory,"""The response of sexual behavior to HIV in Africa is an important input to predicting the path of the epidemic and to focusing prevention efforts.  Existing estimates suggest limited behavioral response, but fail to take into account possible differences across individuals.  A simple model of sexual behavior choice among forward-looking individuals implies that behavioral response should be larger for those with lower non-HIV mortality risks and those who are richer.  I estimate behavioral response using a new instrumental variables strategy, instrumenting for HIV prevalence with distance to the origin of the virus.  I find low response on average, consistent with existing literature, but larger responses for those who face lower non-HIV mortality and for those who are richer.  I also show suggestive evidence, based on a very simple calibration, that the magnitude of behavioral response in Africa is of a similar order of magnitude to that among gay men in the United States, once differences in income and life expectancy are taken into account""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Exchange rate pass-through to export prices some cross-country evidence /,Finance,"""A growing body of empirical work has found evidence of a decline in exchange rate pass-through to import prices in a number of industrial countries. Our paper complements this work by examining pass-through from the other side of the transaction; that is, we assess the exchange rate sensitivity of export prices (denominated in the exporter's currency). We first sketch out a streamlined analytical model that highlights some key factors that determine pass-through. Using this model as reference, we find that the prices charged on exports to the United States are more responsive to the exchange rate than is the case for export prices to other destinations, which is consistent with results in the literature suggesting that import price pass-through in the U.S. market is relatively low. We also find that moves in the exchange rate sensitivity of export prices over time have been significantly affected by country and region-specific factors, including the Asian financial crisis (for emerging Asia), deepening integration with the United States (for Canada), and the effects of the 1992 ERM crisis (for the United Kingdom)""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
The demographic transition and the sexual division of labor,Economic theory,"""This paper presents a theory where increases in female labor force participation and reductions in the gender wage-gap are generated as part of a single process of demographic transition, characterized by reductions in mortality and fertility.  The paper suggests a link between changes in mortality and transformations in the role of women in society that has not been identified before in the literature.  Mortality reductions affect the incentives of individuals to invest in human capital and to have children.  Particularly, gains in adult longevity reduce fertility, increase investments in market human capital, increase female labor force participation, and reduce the wage differential between men and women.  Child mortality reductions, though reducing fertility, do not generate this same pattern of changes.  The model reconciles the increase in female labor market participation with the timing of age-specific mortality reductions observed during the demographic transition.  It generates changes in fertility, labor market attachment, and the gender wage-gap as part of a single process of social transformation, triggered by reductions in mortality""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The determinants of performance appraisal systems a note (do Brown and Heywood's results for Australia hold up for Britain?) /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper offers a replication for Britain of Brown and Heywood's analysis of the determinants of performance appraisal in Australia. Although there are some important limiting differences between our two datasets -- the AWIRS and the WERS -- we reach one central point of agreement and one intriguing shared insight. First, performance appraisal is negatively associated with tenure: where employers cannot rely on the carrot of deferred pay or the stick of dismissal to motivate workers they will tend to rely more on monitoring, ceteris paribus. Alternatively put, when the probability of job separation is greater, the influence of deferred compensation diminishes. Second, there is also some suggestion in the data that employer monitoring and performance pay may be complementary. However, consonant with the disparate results from the wider literature, there is more modest agreement on the contribution of specific HRM practices, and still less on the role of job control. Finally, there is no carry over to Britain of the structural determinants identified by Brown and Heywood""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The ins and outs of cyclical unemployment,Economic theory,"""One of the strongest trends in recent macroeconomic modeling of labor market fluctuations is to treat unemployment inflows as acyclical.  This trend stems in large part from an influential paper by Shimer on ""Reassessing the Ins and Outs of Unemployment,"" i.e., the extent to which increased unemployment during a recession arises from an increase in the number of unemployment spells versus an increase in their duration.  After broadly reviewing the previous literature, we replicate and extend Shimer's main analysis.  Like Shimer, we find an important role for increased duration.  But contrary to Shimer's conclusions, we find that even his own methods and data, when viewed in an appropriate metric, reveal an important role for increased inflows to unemployment as well.  This finding is further strengthened by our refinements of Shimer's methods of correcting for data problems and by our detailed examination of particular components of the inflow to unemployment.  We conclude that a complete understanding of cyclical unemployment requires an explanation of countercyclical inflow rates as well as procyclical outflow rates""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A theory of liquidity and regulation of financial intermediation,Economic theory,"""This paper studies a mechanism design model of financial intermediation.  There are two informational frictions: agents receive unobservable shocks and can participate in markets by engaging in trades unobservable to intermediaries.  Without regulations, intermediaries provide no risk sharing because of an externality arising from arbitrage opportunities.  We identify a simple regulation -- a liquidity requirement -- that corrects such an externality by affecting the interest rate on the markets.  We characterize the form of the optimal liquidity adequacy requirement for a general class of preferences.  We show that whether markets underprovide or overprovide liquidity, and whether a liquidity cap or a liquidity floor should be used depends on the nature of the shocks that agents experience.  Moreover, we prove that the optimal liquidity adequacy requirement implements a constrained efficient allocation subject to unobservable types and trades.  We provide closed form solutions for the optimal liquidity requirement and welfare gains of imposing such requirements for two important special cases.  In contrast with the existing literature, the necessity of regulation does not depend on exogenous incompleteness of markets for aggregate shocks""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Nature and nurture in the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status evidence from swedish children and their biological and rearing parents /,Economic theory,"""This study uses an extraordinary Swedish data set to explore the sources of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status.  Merging data from administrative sources and censuses, we investigate the association between sons' and daughters' socioeconomic outcomes and those of their biological and rearing parents.  Our analysis focuses on children raised in six different family circumstances: raised by both biological parents, raised by the biological mother without a stepfather, raised by the biological mother with a stepfather, raised by the biological father without a stepmother, raised by the biological father with a stepmother, and raised by two adoptive parents.  Relative to the existing literature, the most remarkable feature of our data set is that it contains information on the biological parents even when they are not the rearing parents.  We specify a simple additive model of pre-birth (including genetic) and post-birth influences and examine the model's ability to provide a unified account of the intergenerational associations in all six family types.  Our results suggest substantial roles for both pre-birth and post-birth factors""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A theory of child targeting,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""There is a large empirical literature on policy measures targeted at children but surprisingly very little theoretical foundation to ground the debate on the optimality of the different instruments. In the present paper, we examine the merit of targeting children through two general policies, namely selective commodity taxation and cash transfer to family with children. We consider a household that comprises an adult and a child. The household behavior is described by the maximization of the adult's utility function, which depends on the child's welfare, subject to a budget constraint. The relative effects of a price subsidy and of a cash benefit on child welfare are then derived. In particular, it is shown that 'favorable' distortions from the price subsidies may allow to redistribute toward the child. The framework is extended to account for possible paternalistic preferences of the State. Finally, it is shown that, in contrast to the traditional view, well-chosen subsidies can be more cost effective than cash transfers in alleviating child poverty""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The international transferability of immigrants' human capital skills,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper uses the approach in the under/over education literature to analyze the extent of matching of educational level to occupational attainment among adult native born and foreign born men in the U.S., using the 2000 Census. Overeducation is found to be more common among recent labor market entrants, while undereducation is more likely among older workers. Married men, veterans and those living in metropolitan areas are also more likely to be overeducated. Among immigrants, greater pre-immigration labor market experience is associated with poorer job matches, presumably due to the less than perfect international transferability of skills. A longer duration in the U.S., however, is associated with a lower probability of being overeducated and a greater probability of being undereducated. This is consistent with immigrants being favorably selected for occupational advancement but this effect becomes realized only after overcoming the disadvantages of the less than perfect international transferability of their pre-immigration skills""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Structural estimation of search intensity do non-employed workers search enough? /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""We present a structural framework for the evaluation of public policies intended to increase job search intensity. Most of the literature defines search intensity as a scalar that influences the arrival rate of job offers; here we treat it as the number of job applications that workers send out. The wage distribution and job search intensities are simultaneously determined in market equilibrium. We structurally estimate the search cost distribution, the implied matching probabilities, the productivity of a match, and the flow value of non-labor market time; the estimates are then used to derive the socially optimal distribution of job search intensities. From a social point of view, too few workers participate in the labor market while some unemployed search too much. The low participation rate reflects a standard hold-up problem and the excess number of applications result is due to rent seeking behavior. Sizable welfare gains (15% to 20%) can be realized by simultaneously opening more vacancies and increasing participation. A modest binding minimum wage or conditioning UI benefits on applying for at least one job per period, increases welfare""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Market power and relationships in small business lending,Economic theory,"The empirical research literature regarding the effects of market structure on small business  lending has yielded ambiguous results. This paper empirically tests for the presence of countervailing  effects of increases in market concentration on small business loan volume. Countervailing  effects would be expected if both the traditional Structure, Conduct, Performance  (SCP) paradigm of industrial organization and a paradigm whereby market power benefits the  formation of lending relationships (the relationship hypothesis), are at work. Using Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) data on small loans to small businesses, it is found that, on average,  across MSAs, SCP effects dominate. But, as predicted by the relationship hypothesis, the negative  effects of increases in concentration on small business loan volume are weaker, the greater  the presence of young firms and the higher the business failure rate. Relationship effects due  to business failure appear to come from highly concentrated MSAs. Endogeneity concerns are  further addressed with the estimation of a regression that separates out the effects of changes  in the number of lenders from the effects of changes in the sum of squared deviations of market  shares."
Frequency of observation and the estimation of integrated volatility in deep and liquid financial markets,Finance,"""Using two newly available ultrahigh-frequency datasets, we investigate empirically how frequently one can sample certain foreign exchange and U.S.  Treasury security returns without contaminating estimates of their integrated volatility with market microstructure noise.  Using volatility signature plots and a recently-proposed formal decision rule to select the sampling frequency, we find that one can sample FX returns as frequently as once every 15 to 20 seconds without contaminating volatility estimates; bond returns may be sampled as frequently as once every 2 to 3 minutes on days without U.S.  macroeconomic announcements, and as frequently as once every 40 seconds on announcement days.  With a simple realized kernel estimator, the sampling frequencies can be increased to once every 2 to 5 seconds for FX returns and to about once every 30 to 40 seconds for bond returns.  These sampling frequencies, especially in the case of FX returns, are much higher than those often recommended in the empirical literature on realized volatility in equity markets.  We suggest that the generally superior depth and liquidity of trading in FX and government bond markets contributes importantly to this difference""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Liquidity in asset markets with search frictions,Economic theory,"""We study how trading frictions in asset markets affect the distribution of asset holdings, asset prices, efficiency, and standard measures of liquidity.  To this end, we analyze the equilibrium and optimal allocations of a search-theoretic model of financial intermediation similar to Duffie, Gârleanu and Pedersen (2005).  In contrast with the existing literature, the model we develop imposes no restrictions on asset holdings, so traders can accommodate frictions by varying their trading needs through changes in their asset positions.  We find that this is a critical aspect of investor behavior in illiquid markets.  A reduction in trading frictions leads to an increase in the dispersion of asset holdings and trade volume.  Transaction costs and intermediaries&rsquo; incentives to make markets are nonmonotonic in trade frictions.  With the entry of dealers, these nonmonotonicities give rise to an externality in liquidity provision that can lead to multiple equilibria.  Tight spreads are correlated with large volume and short trading delays across equilibria.  From a normative standpoint we show that the asset allocation across investors and the number of dealers are socially inefficient""--Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland web site."
Money and capital,Economic theory,"""We revisit classic questions concerning the effects of money on investment in a new framework: a two-sector model  where some trade occurs in centralized and some in decentralized markets, as in recent monetary theory, but extended  to include capital.  This allows us to incorporate novel elements from the microfoundations literature on trading with  frictions, including stochastic exchange opportunities, alternative pricing mechanisms, etc.  We calibrate models with  bargaining and with price taking in the decentralized market.  With bargaining, inflation has little impact on investment,  but a sizable impact on welfare: going from 10 percent inflation to the Friedman rule e.g.  barely affects capital, but is  worth 3 percent of consumption.  With price taking, this policy increases capital between 3 percent and 5 percent,  and is worth 1.5 percent of consumption across steady states or 1 percent with transition.  Fiscal distortions are also big.   So is the impact of holdup problems from bargaining, even if the decentralized market accounts for only 5 percent of  output.  Many of these numbers are quite different from previous studies.  Our two-sector specification is a key to the results""--Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland web site."
Endogenizing technological change matching empirical evidence to modeling needs /,Economic theory,"""Given that technologies to significantly reduce fossil fuel emissions are currently unavailable or only available at high cost, technological change will be a key component of any long-term strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In light of this, the amount of research on the pace, direction, and benefits of environmentally-friendly technological change has grown dramatically in recent years.  This research includes empirical work estimating the magnitude of these effects, and modeling exercises designed to simulate the importance of endogenous technological change in response to climate policy.  Unfortunately, few attempts have been made to connect these two streams of research.  This paper attempts to bridge that gap.  We review both the empirical and modeling literature on technological change.  Our focus includes the research and development process, learning by doing, the role of public versus private research, and technology diffusion.  Our goal is to provide an agenda for how both empirical and modeling research in these areas can move forward in a complementary fashion.  In doing so, we discuss both how models used for policy evaluation can better capture empirical phenomena, and how empirical research can better address the needs of models used for policy evaluation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Predictable returns and asset allocation should a skeptical investor time the market? /,Economic theory,"""Are excess returns predictable and if so, what does this mean for investors? Previous literature has tended toward two polar viewpoints: that predictability is useful only if the statistical evidence for it is incontrovertible, or that predictability should affect portfolio choice, even if the evidence is weak according to conventional measures.  This paper models an intermediate view: that both data and theory are useful for decision-making.  We investigate optimal portfolio choice for an investor who is skeptical about the amount of predictability in the data.  Skepticism is modeled as an informative prior over the R^2 of the predictive regression.  We find that the evidence is sufficient to convince even an investor with a highly skeptical prior to vary his portfolio on the basis of the dividend-price ratio and the yield spread.  The resulting weights are less volatile and deliver superior out-of-sample performance as compared to the weights implied by an entirely model-based or data-based view""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Many children left behind? textbooks and test scores in kenya /,Economic theory,"""A randomized evaluation suggests that a program which provided official textbooks to randomly selected rural Kenyan primary schools did not increase test scores for the average student.  In contrast, the previous literature suggests that textbook provision has a large impact on test scores.  Disaggregating the results by students? initial academic achievement suggests a potential explanation for the lack of an overall impact.  Textbooks increased scores for students with high initial academic achievement and increased the probability that the students who had made it to the selective final year of primary school would go on to secondary school.  However, students with weaker academic backgrounds did not benefit from the textbooks.  Many pupils could not read the textbooks, which are written in English, most students? third language.  The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Kenyan education system and curricular materials are oriented to the academically strongest students rather than to typical students.  More generally, many students may be left behind in societies that combine 1) a centralized, unified education system; 2) the heterogeneity in student preparation associated with rapid expansion of education; and 3) disproportionate elite power""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Returns on FDI does the U.S. really do better? /,Economic theory,"""According to the U.S.  external accounts, U.S.  investors earn a significantly higher rate of return on their foreign investments than foreigners earn in the United States.  This continued strong performance has produced a positive net investment income balance despite the deterioration in the U.S.  net asset position in recent years.  We examine the major competing explanations for the apparent differential between the rates of return.  In particular, almost the entire difference occurs in FDI, where American firms operating abroad appear to earn a persistently higher return than that earned by foreign firms operating in the U.S.  We first review a number of explanations in the literature for this differential.  We then offer some new evidence on the role of income shifting between jurisdictions with varying rates of taxation.  Using country-specific income and tax data, we find that about one-third of the excess return earned by U.S.  corporations abroad can be explained by firms reporting ""extra"" income in low tax jurisdictions of their affiliates""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Explaining the effects of government spending shocks on consumption and the real exchange rate,Economic theory,"""Using structural VAR analysis, we document that in a panel of industrialized countries, an increase in government purchases leads to an expansion in output and private consumption, a deterioration in the trade balance, and a depreciation of the real exchange rate (i.e., a decrease in the domestic CPI relative to the exchange-rate adjusted foreign CPI).  We propose an explanation for these observed effects based on the deep habit mechanism.  We estimate the key parameters of the deep-habit model employing a limited information approach.  The predictions of the estimated deep-habit model fit remarkably well the observed responses of output, consumption, the trade balance, and the real exchange rate to an unanticipated government spending shock.  In addition, the deep-habit model predicts that in response to an anticipated increase in government spending consumption and wages fail to increase on impact, which is consistent with the empirical evidence stemming from the narrative identification approach.  In this way, the deep-habit model reconciles the findings of the SVAR and narrative literatures on the effects of government spending shocks""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Keep on scrapping the salvage drives of world war ii /,Economic theory,"""During World War II Americans were called upon repeatedly to salvage raw materials for the war effort, often during brief, highly publicized ""drives."" Stories about the salvage drives are a staple in both popular and scholarly histories of the home front, and in film documentaries, because the drives appear to demonstrate the potential importance of non-economic motives such as patriotism and community spirit.  Here I reexamine economic effects of five drives: aluminum, silk, cooking fat, and the two most important, iron and steel, and rubber.  The drives, it turns out, had a more limited impact on the economy than might be imagined from some of the enthusiastic portrayals in the popular and historical literatures.  At most, the drives increased scrap collections by relatively small margins above what would have been collected during a prosperous peacetime period.  The impact of economic incentives on the supply of scrap materials, and the impact of the maneuvering of special interests for advantage, moreover, can be seen at every turn.  If the drives were important it was through their impact on civilian morale""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Construction and interpretation of model-free implied volatility,Economic theory,"""The notion of model-free implied volatility (MFIV), constituting the basis for the highly publicized VIX volatility index, can be hard to measure with accuracy due to the lack of precise prices for options with strikes in the tails of the return distribution.  This is reflected in practice as the VIX index is computed through a tail-truncation which renders it more compatible with the related concept of corridor implied volatility (CIV).  We provide a comprehensive derivation of the CIV measure and relate it to MFIV under general assumptions.  In addition, we price the various volatility contracts, and hence estimate the corresponding volatility measures, under the standard Black-Scholes model.  Finally, we undertake the first empirical exploration of the CIV measures in the literature.  Our results indicate that the measure can help us refine and systematize the information embedded in the derivatives markets.  As such, the CIV measure may serve as a tool to facilitate empirical analysis of both volatility forecasting and volatility risk pricing across distinct future states of the world for diverse asset categories and time horizons""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trade shocks and labor adjustment a structural empirical approach /,Economic theory,"""The welfare effects of trade shocks depend crucially on the nature and magnitude of the costs workers face in moving between sectors.  The existing trade literature does not directly address this, assuming perfect mobility or complete immobility, or adopting reduced-form approaches to estimation.  We present a model of dynamic labor adjustment that does, and which is, moreover, consistent with a key empirical fact: that intersectoral gross flows greatly exceed net flows.  Using an Euler-type equilibrium condition, we estimate the mean and the variance of workers' switching costs from the U.S.  March Current Population Surveys.  We estimate high values of both parameters, implying both slow adjustment of the economy, and sharp movements in wages, in response to a trade shock.  Simulations of a trade liberalization indicate that despite the high estimated adjustment cost, in terms of lifetime welfare, the liberalization is Pareto-improving.  The explanation for this surprising finding -- which would be missed by a reduced-form approach -- is that the high variance to costs ensures high rates of gross flow; this helps spread the liberalization's benefits around""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Measuring the returns to r&d the depreciation problem /,Economic theory,"""Measuring the private returns to R&D requires knowledge of its private depreciation or obsolescence rate, which is inherently variable and responds to competitive pressure.  Nevertheless, most of the previous literature has used a constant depreciation rate to construct R&D capital stocks and measure the returns to R&D, a rate usually equal to 15 per cent.  In this paper I review the implications of this assumption for the measurement of returns using two different methodologies: one based on the production function and another that uses firm market value to infer returns.  Under the assumption that firms choose their R&D investment optimally, that is, marginal expected benefit equals marginal cost, I show that both estimates of returns can be inverted to derive an implied depreciation rate for R&D capital.  I then test these ideas on a large unbalanced panel of U.S.  manufacturing firms for the years 1974 to 2003.  The two methods do not agree, in that the production function approach suggests depreciation rates near zero (or even appreciation) whereas the market value approach implies depreciation rates ranging from 20 to 40 per cent, depending on the period.  The concluding section discusses the possible reasons for this finding""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Rational and behavioral perspectives on the role of annuities in retirement planning,Economic theory,"""This paper discusses the role of annuities in retirement planning.  It begins by explaining the basic theory underlying the individual welfare gains available from annuitizing resources in retirement.  It then contrasts these findings with the empirical findings that so few consumers behave in a manner that is consistent with them placing a high value on annuities.  After reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of the large literature that seeks to reconcile these findings through richer extensions of the basic model, this paper turns to a somewhat more speculative discussion of potential behavioral stories that may be limiting demand.  Overall, the paper argues that while further extensions to the rational consumer model of annuity demand are useful for helping to clarify under what conditions annuitization is welfare-enhancing, at least part of the answer to why consumers are so reluctant to annuitize will likely be found through a more rigorous study of the various psychological biases that individuals bring to the annuity decision""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Factor endowments and the returns to skill new evidence from the american past /,Economic theory,"""The existing literature on skill-biased technical change has not considered how the technological endowment itself plays a role in the returns to skill.  This paper constructs a simple model of skill biased technical change which highlights the role that resource endowments play in the returns to education.  The model predicts variation in returns to education with skill biased technological change if there is significant heterogeneity in resource endowments before the technological change.  Using a variety of historical sources, we document the heterogeneous technology levels by region in the American past.  We then estimate the returns to education of high school teachers in the early twentieth century using a new data source.  a report from the U.S.  Commissioner of Education in 1909.  Overall, we find significant regional variation in the returns to education that match differences in resource endowments, with large (within-occupation) returns for the Midwest and Southwest (7%), but much lower returns in the South (3%) and West (0.5%).  We also show that our results are generalizable to returns to education in the United States and that returns to education for teachers tracked quite closely with the overall returns to education from 1940 onward""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The general equilibrium incidence of environmental mandates,Economic theory,"""Regulations that restrict pollution by firms also affect decisions about use of labor and capital.  They thus affect relative factor prices, total production, and output prices.  For non-revenue-raising environmental mandates, what are the general equilibrium impacts on the wage, the return to capital, and relative output prices? Perhaps surprisingly, we cannot find any existing analytical literature addressing that question.  This paper starts with the standard two-sector tax incidence model and modifies one sector to include pollution as a factor of production that can be a complement or substitute for labor or for capital.  We then look not at taxes but at four types of mandates, and for each mandate determine conditions that place more of the burden on labor or on capital.  Stricter regulation does not always place less burden on the factor that is a better substitute for pollution.  Also, a relative restriction on the amount of pollution per unit of output creates an ""output-subsidy effect"" on factor prices that can offset and reverse the traditional output effect and substitution effect.  An analogous effect is found for a relative restriction on pollution per unit of capital""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Tenure and output,Economic theory,"""A key tenet of the theory of human capital is that investment in skills results in higher productivity.  The previous literature has estimated the degree of investment in human capital for individuals by looking at individual wage growth as a proxy for productivity growth.  In this paper, we have both wage and personal productivity data, and thus are able to measure of the increase in workers' output with tenure.  The data is from an autoglass company.  Most of production occurs at the individual level so measures of output are clear.  We find a very steep learning curve in the year on the job: output is 53 percent higher after one year than it is initially when hired.  These output gains with tenure are not reflected in equal percentage pay gains: pay profiles are much flatter than output profiles in the first year and a half on the job.  For these data, using wage profiles significantly underestimates the amount of investment compared to the gains evident in output-tenure profiles.  The pattern of productivity rising more rapidly than pay reverses after two years of tenure.  Worker selection is also important.  Workers who stay longer have higher output levels and faster early learning""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Monopoly and the incentive to innovate when adoption involves switchover disruptions,Economic theory,"""When considering the incentive of a monopolist to adopt an innovation, the textbook model assumes that it can instantaneously and seamlessly introduce the new technology. In fact, firms often face major problems in integrating new technologies. In some cases, firms have to (temporarily) produce at levels substantially below capacity upon adoption. We call such phenomena switchover disruptions, and present extensive evidence on them. If firms face switchover disruptions, then they may temporarily lose some unit sales upon adoption. If the firm loses unit sales, then a cost of adoption is the foregone rents on the sales of those units. Hence, greater market power will mean higher prices on those lost units of output, and hence a reduced incentive to innovate. We introduce switchover disruptions into some standard models in the literature, show they can overturn some famous results, and then show they can help explain evidence that firms in more competitive environments are more likely to adopt technologies and increase productivity""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
The spike at benefit exhaustion leaving the unemployment system or starting a new job? /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In this paper, we review the literature on the ""spike"" in unemployment exit rates around benefit exhaustion, and present new evidence based on administrative data for a large sample of job losers in Austria. We find that the way unemployment spells are measured has a large effect on the magnitude of the spike at exhaustion, both in existing studies and in our Austrian data. Spikes are typically much smaller when spell length is defined by the time to next job than when it is defined by the time spent on the unemployment system. In Austria, the exit rate from registered unemployment rises by over 200% at the expiration of benefits, while the hazard rate of re-employment rises by only 20%. The difference between the two measures arises because many individuals leave the unemployment register immediately after their benefits expire without returning to work. The modest spike in re-employment rates implies that most job seekers do not wait until their UI benefits are exhausted to return to work: fewer than 1% of jobless spells have an ending date that is manipulated to coincide with the expiration of UI benefits""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."

"The evolution of inequality, heterogeneity and uncertainty in labor earnings in the U.S. economy","Industries, Land use, Labor","""A large empirical literature documents a rise in wage inequality in the American economy. It is silent on whether the increase in inequality is due to greater heterogeneity in the components of earnings that are predictable by agents or whether it is due to greater uncertainty faced by agents. Applying the methodology of Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2005) to data on agents making schooling decisions in different economic environments, we join choice data with earnings data to estimate the fraction of future earnings that is forecastable and how this fraction has changed over time. We find that both predictable and unpredictable components of earnings have increased in recent years. The increase in uncertainty is substantially greater for unskilled workers. For less skilled workers, roughly 60% of the increase in wage variability is due to uncertainty. For more skilled workers, only 8% of the increase in wage variability is due to uncertainty. Roughly 26% of the increase in the variance of returns to schooling is due to increased uncertainty. Using conventional measures of income inequality masks the contribution of rising uncertainty to the rise in the inequality of earnings for less educated groups""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Well-being and ill-being a bivariate panel data analysis /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The aim of this paper is to estimate in a multivariate context the factors associated with well-being and ill-being without making the assumptions that they are opposite ends of the same continuum, and that the factors uniformly affect both well-being and ill-being. Using the first five waves of panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we jointly model positive and negative well-being in a two-equation dynamic panel data model. We found that while past ill-being had significant effect on current well-being there was no support for a reverse relationship (i.e. lagged effect of well-being on current ill-being). In addition, we also found support for asymmetry in how certain factors affect well-being and ill-being. The implication of the findings in this paper for the happiness literature is that for future empirical work, it would perhaps more prudent to begin with the notion that well-being and ill-being are distinct dimensions, that the unobservables that affect well-being and ill-being are correlated, and to specify econometric models that allow for these concepts to be reflected""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Where are the real bottlenecks? evidence from 20,000 firms in 60 countries about the shadow costs of constraints to firm performance","Industries, Land use, Labor","""We use data from over 20,000 firms in 60 countries to identify constraints on the growth of firms. We interpret managers' answers to survey questions on the extent to which various aspects of their external environment inhibit the performance of their firm as measuring the shadow cost of constraints to their activities, not as direct measures of the constraints. These costs can vary with firm characteristics as well as with the magnitude of the constraints themselves. Our model reveals that, contrary to common practice, the importance of an obstacle to performance is not, except under very restrictive assumptions, measured by the coefficient on the reported level of the obstacle in a performance regression. We test the predictions of the model on the large firm-level dataset and show how the importance of different constraints varies across countries and how the cost of a constraint depends on the characteristics of the firm. We find that telecoms are less important, and taxes more important, as constraints on performance than the literature has previously identified""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Innovation and export portfolios,Finance,"""This paper examines the link between sectoral concentration and overall performance in the search for on-the-frontier innovations, inside-the-frontier innovations, and export booms.  It extends the literature by increasing country coverage and the types of search processes considered, and by focusing on the links with overall performance in these search processes.  After controlling for the necessary relationships as well as fixed effects at the country/commodity group level, the paper finds a clear negative relationship between the concentration of innovation portfolios and performance: countries that are the most successful in these search processes have their successes spread across a broader range of industries than those with poorer performance.  Furthermore, the search for export booms exhibits the least amount of sectoral concentration and path-dependence.  These findings suggest that public support for these processes need not be focused in a narrow range of sectors, and modeling of these processes in theoretical work, particularly in the search for export booms, should be of a stochastic flavor.

Why does ethnic diversity undermine public goods provision? an experimental approach,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A large and growing literature links high levels of ethnic diversity to low levels of public goods provision. Yet while the empirical connection between ethnic heterogeneity and the underprovision of public goods is widely accepted, there is little consensus on the specific mechanisms through which this relationship operates. To gain analytic leverage on the question of why ethnicity matters, we identify three families of mechanisms -- what we term preference, technology, and strategy mechanisms. Our empirical strategy is to identify and run a series of experimental games that permit us to examine these mechanisms in isolation and then to compare the importance of ethnicity in each. Results from experimental games conducted with a random sample of 300 subjects in Kampala's slums reveal that successful collective action among homogenous ethnic communities in urban Uganda is attributable to the existence of norms and institutions that facilitate the sanctioning of non-contributors. We find no evidence for a commonality of tastes within ethnic groups, for greater degrees of altruism toward co-ethnics, or for an impact of shared ethnicity on the productivity of teams""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Diagnosing discrimination stock returns and CEO gender /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A vast labor literature has found evidence of a ""glass ceiling"", whereby women are under-represented among senior management. A key question remains the extent to which this reflects unobserved differences in productivity, preferences, prejudice, or systematically biased beliefs about the ability of female managers. Disentangling these theories would require data on productivity, on the preferences of those who interact with managers, and on perceptions of productivity. Financial markets provide continuous measures of the market's perception of the value of firms, taking account of the beliefs of market participants about the ability of the men and women in senior management. As such, financial data hold the promise of potentially providing insight into the presence of mistake-based discrimination. Specifically if female-headed firms were systematically under-estimated, this would suggest that female-headed firms would outperform expectations, yielding excess returns. Examining data on S&P 1500 firms over the period 1992-2004 I find no systematic differences in returns to holding stock in female-headed firms, although this result reflects the weak statistical power of our test, rather than a strong inference that financial markets either do or do not under-estimate female CEOs""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Is demand-pulled innovation equally important in different groups of firms?,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Previous empirical literature - mainly cross-sectional - has tested the demand-pull hypothesis and found that overall, evidence does not conflict with the idea that innovation may be driven by output. Using a balanced panel of 216 Italian manufacturing firms over the 1995-2000 period, and checking for fixed effects, time, sectoral and size dummies and for the path-dependent nature of R&D, we also find a (barely significant) role of sales in inducing R&D expenditures. However, at the micro level, the demand-pull effect plays a varying role for the different sub-samples of firms. In particular, exporting firms, those which are liquidity-constrained, those not receiving public subsidies and those not heading a business group, seem to be particularly sensitive to sales in deciding their R&D expenditures. These microeconometric results have been obtained using a Least Squares Dummy Variable Corrected (LSDVC) estimator, a recently-proposed panel data technique particularly suitable for small samples""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Earnings inequality in India has the rise of caste and religion based politics in India had an impact? /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Since 1989, there has been a sharp increase in the role of caste and religion in determining political fortunes at both state and federal levels in India. As a consequence, significant inter-caste and inter-religion differences in earnings have the potential to stall the process of economic reforms. Yet, the patterns and determinants of such differences remain unexplored. We address this lacuna in the literature, and explore the determinants of the differences in inter-caste and inter-religion earnings in India during the 1987-99 period, using the 43rd and 55th rounds of National Sample Survey (NSS). Our results suggest that (a) earnings differences between ""upper"" castes and SC/ST have declined between 1987 and 1999, (b) over the same period, earnings differences between Muslims and non-Muslims have increased, to the detriment of the former, and (c) inter-caste and inter-religion differences in earnings can be explained largely by corresponding differences in educational endowment and returns on age (and, hence, experience). However, differences in returns on education do not explain inter-caste and inter-religion earnings differences to a great extent""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Determinants and consequences of bargaining power in households,Economic theory,"""A growing literature offers indirect evidence that the distribution of bargaining power within a household influences decisions made by the household.  The indirect evidence links household outcomes to variables that are assumed to influence the distribution of power within the household.  In this paper, we have data on whether a husband or wife in the Health and Retirement Study ""has the final say"" when making major decisions in a household.  We use this variable to analyze determinants and some consequences of bargaining power.  Our analysis overcomes endogeneity problems arising in many earlier studies and constitutes a missing link confirming the importance of household bargaining models.We find that decision-making power depends on plausible individual variables and also influences important household outcomes, with the second set of results much stronger than the first set.  Current and lifetime earnings have significant but moderate effects on decision-making power.  On the other hand, decision-making power has important effects on financial decisions like stock market investment and total wealth accumulation and may help explain, for example, the relatively high poverty rate among widows""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Econometric risk adjustment, endogeneity, and extrapolation bias",Economic theory,"""In econometric risk-adjustment exercises, models estimated with one or more included endogenous explanatory variables (""risk adjusters"") will generally result in biased predictions of outcomes of interest, e.g.  unconditional mean healthcare expenditures.  This paper shows that a first-order contributor to this prediction bias is the difference between the distribution of explanatory variables in the estimation sample and the prediction sample -- a form of ""extrapolation bias."" In the linear model context, a difference in the means of the respective joint marginal distributions of observed covariates suffices to produce bias when endogenous explanatory variables are used in estimation.  If these means do not differ, then the ""endogeneity-related"" extrapolation bias disappears although a form of ""standard"" extrapolation bias may persist.  These results are extended to some of the nonlinear models in common use in this literature with some provisionally-similar conclusions.  In general the bias problem will be most acute where risk adjustment is most useful, i.e.  when estimated risk-adjustment models are applied in populations whose characteristics differ from those from which the estimation data are drawn""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Is there a trade-off between job security and wages in Germany and the UK?,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper looks at the wage effects of perceived and objective insecurity in Germany and the UK using the GSOEP and BHPS panels. The distinction between perceived worry about job loss and economic indicators such as regional unemployment rates and the share of temporary contracts is established. The bargaining hypothesis that job security and wages are complements because of union bargaining power and preference is derived from a variant of the right to manage model. This hypothesis is contrasted with Rosen's theory of equalising differences where security and wages are substitutes. The empirical literature surveyed finds evidence for both sides. When addressing a number of econometric issues in earlier studies of the bargaining hypothesis this paper finds strong evidence in favour of the former. Accounting for simultaneous determination of job insecurity and wages significantly negative level effects are found for Germany with some evidence for those in the UK. There is also some evidence for growth rate effects (especially for perceived insecurity), but it does not appear robust. Job insecurity, both perceived and objective is found to have influenced wage development in both countries""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The impact of wealth on job exit rates of elderly workers,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In the literature theoretical models have appeared that predict a positive impact of the level of individual wealth on the job exit probability. Empirically this prediction is most likely to be relevant for elderly workers who have been able to accumulate wealth throughout their working life and whose residual working life is relatively short. In the Netherlands, as in other European countries, there is a tendency of introducing more individual choice options in pension schemes. It is likely that the individual level of wealth will become an increasingly important factor in the retirement decision. Therefore it is interesting to know whether individuals with a different financial situation make different job exit decisions, given other factors. Empirical analysis of job exit behaviour of elderly workers so far has concentrated on properties of the pension system and the health situation. For a sample of elderly male workers in the Netherlands in the period 1995 through 2001, we analyse the impact of wealth, savings, and debt position on job exit rates.

Risk attitudes of nascent entrepreneurs new evidence from an experimentally-validated survey /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The influence of risk aversion on the decision to become self-employed is a much discussed topic in the entrepreneurial literature. Conventional wisdom asserts that the role model of an entrepreneur requires to make risky decisions in uncertain environments and hence that more risk-averse individuals are less likely to become an entrepreneur. Empirical tests of this assumption are scarce however, mainly because reliable measures for risk-aversion are not available. We base our analysis on the most recent waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) which allow us to use experimentally-validated measures of risk attitudes. Most importantly and in contrast to previous research, we are able to examine whether the decision of starting a business is influenced by objectively measurable risk attitudes at the time when this decision is made. Our results show that in general individuals with lower risk aversion are more likely to become self-employed. Sensitivity analysis reveals, however, that this is true only for people coming out of regular employment, whereas for individuals coming out of unemployment or inactivity risk attitudes do not seem to play a role in the decision process""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Testing dependence among serially correlated multi-category variables,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The contingency table literature on tests for dependence among discrete multi-category variables is extensive. Existing tests assume, however, that draws are independent, and there are no tests that account for serial dependencies -- a problem that is particularly important in economics and finance. This paper proposes a new test of independence based on the maximum canonical correlation between pairs of discrete variables. We also propose a trace canonical correlation test using dynamically augmented reduced rank regressions or an iterated weighting method in order to account for serial dependence. Such tests are useful, for example, when testing for predictability of one sequence of discrete random variables by means of another sequence of discrete random variables as in tests of market timing skills or business cycle analysis. The proposed tests allow for an arbitrary number of categories, are robust in the presence of serial dependencies and are simple to implement using multivariate regression methods. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed tests have good finite sample properties. An empirical application to survey data on forecasts of GDP growth demonstrates the importance of correcting for serial dependencies in predictability tests""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Spatial dependence in models of state fiscal policy convergence,Economic theory,"""We apply spatial econometric techniques to models of state and local fiscal policy convergence.  Total tax revenue and expenditures, as well as broad tax and expenditure categories, of state and local governments in each of the 48 contiguous U.S.  states are examined.  We extend work by Scully (1991) and Annala (2003) in much the same way that Rey and Montouri (1999) extended the literature dealing with income convergence among U.S.  states.  Our results indicate that most fiscal policies have been converging and exhibit spatial dependence.  A more specific interpretation of our general spatial results is that the finding of spatial dependence indicates that the growth paths of state and local fiscal policies are not independent.  In addition, we find that total expenditures have been converging faster than output, whereas total tax revenues have been converging slower that output.  Our models further demonstrate that state expenditure growth is dependent upon expenditure growth in economically and demographically similar states, while output growth and revenue growth in a state are dependent on output growth and revenue growth, respectively, in contiguous states""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
New evidence on gender difference in promotion rates an empirical analysis of a sample of new hires /,Economic theory,"""Using a large sample of establishments drawn from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (MCSUI) employer survey, we study gender differences in promotion rates and in the wage gains attached to promotions.  Several unique features of our data distinguish our analysis from the previous literature on this topic.  First, we have information on the wage increases attached to promotions, and relatively few studies on gender differences have considered promotions and wage increases together.  Second, our data include job-specific worker performance ratings, allowing us to control for performance and ability more precisely than through commonly-used skill indicators such as educational attainment or tenure.  Third, in addition to standard information on occupation and industry, we have data on a number of other firm characteristics, enabling us to control for these variables while still relying on a broad, representative sample, as opposed to a single firm or a similarly narrowly-defined population.  Our results indicate that women have lower probabilities of promotion and expected promotion than do men but that there is essentially no gender difference in wage growth with or without promotions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Assessing structural vars,Finance,"""This paper analyzes the quality of VAR-based procedures for estimating the response of the economy to a shock.  We focus on two key issues.  First, do VAR-based confidence intervals accurately reflect the actual degree of sampling uncertainty associated with impulse response functions? Second, what is the size of bias relative to confidence intervals, and how do coverage rates of confidence intervals compare with their nominal size? We address these questions using data generated from a series of estimated dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium models.  We organize most of our analysis around a particular question that has attracted a great deal of attention in the literature: How do hours worked respond to an identified shock? In all of our examples, as long as the variance in hours worked due to a given shock is above the remarkably low number of 1 percent, structural VARs perform well.  This finding is true regardless of whether identification is based on short-run or long-run restrictions.  Confidence intervals are wider in the case of long-run restrictions.  Even so, long-run identified VARs can be useful for discriminating among competing economic models""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Ramsey meets hosios the optimal capital tax and labor market efficiency /,Finance,"""Heterogeneity between unemployed and employed individuals matters for optimal fiscal policy.  This paper considers the consequences of welfare heterogeneity between these two groups for the determination of optimal capital and labor income taxes in a model with matching frictions in the labor market.  In line with a recent finding in the literature, we find that the optimal capital tax is typically non-zero because it is used to indirectly mitigate an externality along the extensive labor margin that arises from search and matching frictions.  However, the consideration of heterogeneity makes our result differ in an important way: even for a well-known parameter configuration (the Hosios condition) that typically eliminates this externality, we show that the optimal capital income tax is still non-zero.  We also show that labor adjustment along the intensive margin has an important effect on efficiency at the extensive margin, and hence on the optimal capital tax, independent of welfare heterogeneity.  Taken together, our results show that these two empirically-relevant features of the labor market can have a quantitatively-important effect on the optimal capital tax""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Robust inference with multi-way clustering,Economic theory,"""In this paper we propose a new variance estimator for OLS as well as for nonlinear estimators such as logit, probit and GMM, that provcides cluster-robust inference when there is two-way or multi-way clustering that is non-nested.  The variance estimator extends the standard cluster-robust variance estimator or sandwich estimator for one-way clustering (e.g.  Liang and Zeger (1986), Arellano (1987)) and relies on similar relatively weak distributional assumptions.  Our method is easily implemented in statistical packages, such as Stata and SAS, that already offer cluster-robust standard errors when there is one-way clustering.  The method is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo analysis for a two-way random effects model; a Monte Carlo analysis of a placebo law that extends the state-year effects example of Bertrand et al.  (2004) to two dimensions; and by application to two studies in the empirical public/labor literature where two-way clustering is present""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Methodological issues in the evaluation of parental involvement laws evidence from texas /,Economic theory,"""The number of states that require parental involvement in a minor's decision to terminate a pregnancy has more than doubled since 1988.  Congress is currently considering legislation that would further limit access to abortion for minors who reside in states that enforce parental involvement laws.  So far, the academic literature has not reached a consensus as to the impact of such abortion restrictions, mainly due to methodological limitations caused by the inability to measure cross-state travel and misclassification of exposure.  Using detailed data on abortions and births from Texas, we demonstrate that these limitations led researchers to overestimate the decline in minors' abortion rate, underestimate the increase in their birth rate, and to miss an important behavioral response to the law, which is the tendency to delay the abortion among a group of older minors.  Correction of these methodological problems is important given the controversy surrounding abortion and the need of voters and policymakers to accurately assess the likely impact of these laws""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Early childhood development in Latin America and the Caribbean,Finance,"""There is considerable evidence that young children in many developing countries suffer from profound deficits in nutrition, health, fine and gross motor skills, cognitive development, and socio-emotional development.  Early childhood development (ECD) outcomes are important markers of the welfare of children.  In addition, the deleterious effects of poor outcomes in early childhood can be long-lasting, affecting school attainment, employment, wages, criminality, and measures of social integration of adults.  This paper considers the theoretical case to be made for investments in early childhood, selectively reviews the literature on the impact of ECD programs in the United States, discusses the evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean, and makes suggestions for future research.  The focus is on the relation between outcomes in early childhood and measures of household socioeconomic status, child health, and parenting practices, as well as on the impact of specific policies and programs.  The knowledge base on early childhood outcomes is still thin in Latin America and the Caribbean.  There are therefore very high returns to comparative descriptive analysis in the region, as well as to careful evaluations of the impact of various programs. ""--World Bank web site."
"Nontraded goods, market segmentation, and exchange rates",Economic theory,"""Empirical evidence suggests that movements in international relative prices (such as the real exchange rate) are large and persistent. Nontraded goods, both in the form of final consumption goods and as an input into the production of final tradable goods, are an important aspect behind international relative price movements. In this paper we show that nontraded goods have important implications for exchange rate behavior, even though fluctuations in the relative price of nontraded goods account for a relatively small fraction of real exchange rate movements. In our quantitative study nontraded goods magnify the volatility of exchange rates when compared to the model without nontraded goods. Cross-country correlations and the correlation of exchange rates with other macro variables are closer in line with the data. In addition, contrary to a large literature,standard alternative assumptions about the currency in which firms price their goods are virtually inconsequential for the properties of aggregate variables in our model, other than the terms of trade.""--Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond web site."
"A new data set of educational attainment in the world, 1950-2010",Economic theory,"""Our panel data set on educational attainment has been updated for 146 countries from 1950 to 2010.  The data are disaggregated by sex and by 5-year age intervals.  We have improved the accuracy of estimation by using information from consistent census data, disaggregated by age group, along with new estimates of mortality rates and completion rates by age and education level.  We use these new data to investigate how output relates to the stock of human capital, measured by overall years of schooling as well as by the composition of educational attainment of workers at various levels of education.  We find schooling has a significantly positive effect on output.  After controlling for the simultaneous determination of human capital and output, by using the 10-year lag of parents' education as an instrument variable (IV) for the current level of education, the estimated rate-of-return to an additional year of schooling ranges from 5% to 12%, close to typical Mincerian return estimates found in the labor literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Putting per-capita income back into trade theory,Economic theory,"""A major role for per-capita income in international trade, as opposed to simply country size, was persuasively advanced by Linder (1961).  Yet this crucial element of Linder's story was abandon by most later trade economists in favor of the analytically-tractable but counter-empirical assumption that all countries share identical and homothetic preferences.  This paper collects and unifies a number of disjoint points in the existing literature and builds further on them using simple and tractable alternative preferences.  Adding non-homothetic preferences to a traditional models helps explain such diverse phenomenon as growing wage gaps, the mystery of the missing trade, home bias in consumption, and the role of intra-country income distribution, solely from the demand side of general equilibrium.  With imperfect competition, we can explain higher markups and higher price levels in higher per-capita income countries, and the puzzle that gravity equations show a positive dependence of trade on per-capita incomes, aggregate income held constant.  In all cases, the effects of growth are quite different depending on whether it is growth in productivity or through factor accumulation.  The paper concludes with some suggestions for calibration, estimation, and gravity equations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Building social capital through microfinance,Economic theory,"""A number of development assistance programs promote community interaction as a means of building social capital.  Yet, despite strong theoretical underpinnings, the role of repeat interactions in sustaining cooperation has proven difficult to identify empirically.  We provide the first experimental evidence on the economic returns to social interaction in the context of microfinance.  Random variation in the frequency of mandatory meetings across first-time borrower groups generates exogenous and persistent changes in clients' social ties.  We show that the resulting increases in social interaction among clients more than a year later are associated with improvements in informal risk-sharing and reductions in default.  A second field experiment among a subset of clients provides direct evidence that more frequent interaction increases economic cooperation among clients.  Our results indicate that group lending is successful in achieving low rates of default without collateral not only because it harnesses existing social capital, as has been emphasized in the literature, but also because it builds new social capital among participants""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Exports, borders, distance, and plant size",Economic theory,"""The fact that large manufacturing plants export relatively more than small plants has been at the foundation of much work in the international trade literature.  We examine this fact using Census micro data on plant shipments from the Commodity Flow Survey.  We show the fact is not entirely an international trade phenomenon; part of it can be accounted for by the effect of distance, distinct from any border effect.  Export destinations tend to be further than domestic destinations, and large plants tend to ship further distances even to domestic locations, as compared with small plants.  We develop an extension of the Melitz (2003) model and use it to set up an analysis with model interpretations of ratios between large plant and small plant shipments that can be calculated with the data.  We obtain a decomposition of the overall ratio into a term that varies with distance, holding fixed the border, and a term that varies with the border, holding fixed the distance.  The distance term accounts for more than half of the overall difference""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Measurement errors in investment equations,Economic theory,"""We use Monte Carlo simulations and real data to assess the performance of alternative methods that deal with measurement error in investment equations.  Our experiments show that individual-fixed effects, error heteroscedasticity, and data skewness severely affect the performance and reliability of methods found in the literature.  In particular, estimators that use higher-order moments are shown to return biased coefficients for (both) mismeasured and perfectly-measured regressors.  These estimators are also very inefficient.  Instrumental variables-type estimators are more robust and efficient, although they require fairly restrictive assumptions.  We estimate empirical investment models using alternative methods.  Real-world investment data contain firm-fixed effects and heteroscedasticity, causing high-order moments estimators to deliver coefficients that are unstable across different specifications and not economically meaningful.  Instrumental variables methods yield estimates that are robust and seem to conform to theoretical priors.  Our analysis provides guidance for dealing with the problem of measurement error under circumstances empirical researchers are likely to find in practice""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
On the formation of coalitions to provide public goods - experimental evidence from the lab,Economic theory,"""The provision of public goods often relies on voluntary contributions and cooperation.  While most of the experimental literature focuses on individual contributions, many real-world problems involve the formation of institutions among subgroups (coalitions) of players.  International agreements serve as one example.  This paper experimentally tests theory on the formation of coalitions in different institutions and compares those to a voluntary contribution mechanism.  The experiment confirms the rather pessimistic conclusions from the theory: only few players form a coalition when the institution prescribes the full internalization of mutual benefits of members.  Contrary to theory, coalitions that try to reduce the free-riding incentives by requiring less provision from their members, do not attract additional members.  Substantial efficiency gains occur, however, both along the extensive and intensive margin when coalition members can each suggest a minimum contribution level with the smallest common denominator being binding.  The experiment thereby shows that the acceptance of institutions depends on how terms of coalitions are reached""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The effect of housing on portfolio choice,Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  A large theoretical literature predicts that housing has substantial effects on financial markets, but empirical evidence on these effects remains limited.  We estimate the causal effect of changes in mortgages and home equity on portfolio allocations using two empirical strategies.  First, we use two instruments -- average house prices in an individual's state in the current year and in the year he purchased his home -- to generate cross-sectional variation in home equity and mortgages that is plausibly orthogonal to unobserved determinants of portfolios.  Second, we use panel data to study how portfolio allocations change when individuals buy houses.  Both empirical strategies show that housing reduces the amount households invest in stocks substantially: a $10,000 increase in mortgage debt (holding fixed total wealth) reduces the stock share of liquid wealth by approximately 6%.  Auxiliary evidence suggests that housing induces individuals to hold more conservative portfolios primarily because of a ""consumption commitment"" effect rather than exposure to house price risk""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The risk content of exports a portfolio view of international trade /,Economic theory,"""It has been suggested that countries which export in especially risky sectors will experience higher output volatility.  This paper develops a measure of the riskiness of a country's pattern of export specialization, and illustrates its features across countries and over time.  The exercise reveals large cross-country differences in the risk content of exports.  This measure is strongly correlated with terms-of-trade and output volatility, but does not exhibit a close relationship to the level of income, overall trade openness, or other country characteristics.  We then propose an explanation for what determines the risk content of exports, based on the theoretical literature exemplified by Turnovsky (1974).  Countries with comparative advantage in the safe sectors or strong enough comparative advantage in the risky sectors will specialize, whereas countries whose comparative advantage in the risky sectors is not too strong will diversify their export structure to insure against export income risk.  We use both non-parametric and parametric techniques to demonstrate that these theoretical predictions are strongly supported by the data""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How can policy encourage economically sensible climate adaptation?,Economic theory,"""This paper considers the role of incentive based climate adaptation policies.  It uses the early literature on pricing and capacity choices under demand uncertainty to describe how revised price structures for the substitutes for climate services can be treated as anticipatory adaptation.  In many situations the policies determining the prices of these services make them difficult to adjust.  Thus, excess demand will not be managed through price adjustment.  This situation is important because it implies that the rationing rules determining who is served influence both capacity planning and pricing decisions.  The lesson drawn from these models is that reform of pricing policy for climate substitutes offers a ready basis for incentive based adaptation policy.  The last part of the paper offers some empirical evidence on how the price elasticity of the residential demand for water changes with variations in seasonal precipitation.  The findings suggest marked differences between normal and dry conditions for the Phoenix metropolitan area.  These results reinforce the need to co-ordinate changes in pricing policy with any capacity planning developed for water supplies as part of anticipatory climate adaptation.  Similar relationships may well apply for other substitutes for climatic services""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Privatization and nationalization cycles,Economic theory,"""This paper studies the cycles of nationalization and privatization in resource-rich economies.  We discuss available evidence on the drivers and consequences of privatization and nationalization, review the existing literature, and present illustrative case studies.  Our main contribution is then to develop a static and dynamic model of the choice between private and national regimes for the ownership of natural resources.  In the model, this choice is driven by a basic equality-efficiency tradeoff: national ownership results in more redistribution of income and more equality, but undermines incentives for effort.  The resolution of the tradeoff depends on external and domestic conditions that affect the value of social welfare under each regime.  This allows us to characterize how external variables - such as the commodity price - and domestic ones - such as the tax system - affect the choice of private vs.  national regimes.  The analysis therefore identifies the determinants of the observed cycles of privatization and nationalization, and is consistent with a variety of observed phenomena""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Identifying provider prejudice in healthcare,Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  We use simple economic insights to develop a framework for distinguishing between prejudice and statistical discrimination using observational data.  We focus our inquiry on the enormous literature in healthcare where treatment disparities by race and gender are not explained by access, preferences, or severity.  But treatment disparities, by themselves, cannot distinguish between two competing views of provider behavior.  Physicians may consciously or unconsciously withhold treatment from minority groups despite similar benefits (prejudice) or because race and gender are associated with lower benefit from treatment (statistical discrimination).  We demonstrate that these two views can only be distinguished using data on patient outcomes: for patients with the same propensity to be treated, prejudice implies a higher return from treatment for treated minorities, while statistical discrimination implies that returns are equalized.  Using data on heart attack treatments, we do not find empirical support for prejudice-based explanations.  Despite receiving less treatment, women and blacks receive slightly lower benefits from treatment, perhaps due to higher stroke risk, delays in seeking care, and providers over-treating minorities due to equity and liability concerns""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Interpreting the unconventional U.S. monetary policy of 2007-09,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews the unconventional U.S.  monetary policy responses to the financial and real crises of 2007-09, divided into three groups: interest rate policy, quantitative policy, and credit policy.  To interpret interest rate policy, it compares the Federal Reserve's actions with the literature on optimal policy in a liquidity trap.  The theory suggests that, to minimize the length and severity of the recession, would require a stronger commitment to low interest rates for an extended period of time.  To interpret quantitative policy, the paper reviews the determination of inflation under different policy regimes.  The main danger for inflation from current actions is that the Federal Reserve may lose its policy independence; a beneficial side effect of the crisis is that the Friedman rule can be implemented by paying interest on reserves.  To interpret credit policy, the paper presents a new model of capital market imperfections with different financial institutions and a role for securitization, leveraging, and mark-to-market accounting.  The model suggests that providing credit to traders in securities markets can restore liquidity with fewer government funds than extending credit to the originators of loans""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Tax competition and migration the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis revisited /,Economic theory,"""The literature on tax competition with free capital mobility cites several reasons for the race-to-the-bottom hypothesis in the sense that tax competition may yield significantly lower tax rates than tax coordination.  With a fixed (exogenously given) population that can move from one fiscal jurisdiction to another, the Tiebout paradigm suggests that tax competition among these jurisdictions yields an efficient outcome, so that there are no gains from tax coordination.  The Tiebout paradigm considers the allocation of a given population among competing localities.  Our model of international tax-transfer and migration competition among host countries deviates from the Tiebout paradigm in that the total population in the host countries and its skill distribution are endogenously determined through migration of various skills.  As a result, competition needs not be efficient.  This paper suggests that when a group of host countries faces an upward supply of immigrants, tax competition does not indeed lead to a race to the bottom; competition may lead to higher taxes than coordination""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Inequality at birth some causes and consequences /,Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.

Recent research shows that health at birth is affected by many factors, including maternal education, behaviors, and participation in social programs.  In turn, endowments at birth are predictive of adult outcomes, and of the outcomes of future generations.  Exposure to environmental pollution is one potential determinant of health at birth that has received increasing attention.  A large literature outside of economics advocates for ""Environmental Justice,"" and argues that poor and minority families are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards.  I provide new evidence on this question, showing that children born to less educated and minority mothers are more likely to be exposed to pollution in utero and that white, college educated mothers are particularly responsive to changes in environmental amenities.  I estimate that differences in exposure to toxic releases may explain 6% of the gap in incidence of low birth weight between infants of white college educated mothers and infants of black high school dropout mothers""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Sex ratios, entrepreneurship, and economic growth in the People's Republic of China",Economic theory,"""China experiences an increasingly severe relative surplus of men in the pre-marital age cohort.  The existing literature on its consequences focuses mostly on negative aspects such as crime.  In this paper, we provide evidence that the imbalance may also stimulate economic growth by inducing more entrepreneurship and hard work.  First, new domestic private firms - an important engine of growth - are more likely to emerge from regions with a higher sex ratio imbalance.  Second, the likelihood for parents with a son to be entrepreneurs rises with the local sex ratio.  Third, households with a son in regions with a more skewed sex ratio demonstrate a greater willingness to accept relatively dangerous or unpleasant jobs and supply more work days.  In contrast, the labor supply pattern by households with a daughter is unrelated to the sex ratio.  Finally, regional GDP tends to grow faster in provinces with a higher sex ratio.  Since the sex ratio imbalance will become worse in the near future, this growth effect is likely to persist""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
New evidence on teacher labor supply,Economic theory,"""Recent evidence on the large variance in teacher effectiveness has spurred renewed interest in teacher labor market policies.  A substantial body of prior research documents that more highly qualified teachers tend to work in more advantaged schools, although this literature cannot determine the relative importance of supply versus demand factors in generating this equilibrium outcome.  To isolate the importance of teacher labor supply, we attended three large teacher job fairs in Chicago during the summer of 2006 and collected detailed information on the specific schools at which teachers interviewed.  We document a substantial variation in the number of applicants per school, with some schools having fewer than five applicants and others schools having over 300 applicants, even after controlling for the number and type of positions advertised at the school.  We show that the demographic characteristics of schools strongly predict the number of applicants to the school in the expected direction.  Interestingly, the geographic location of the school is an extremely strong predictor of applications, even after controlling for a host of observable school and neighborhood characteristics""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The returns to the brain drain and brain circulation in Sub-Saharan Africa some computations using data from ghana /,Economic theory,"""We look at the decision of the government or ""central planner"" in the allocation of scarce governmental resources for tertiary education, as well as that for the individual.  We provide estimates of the net present values, or cost and benefits.  These include costs of tertiary education; the benefits of improved skills of those who remain in the country; and also takes into account the flows of the skilled out of the country (the brain drain) as well as the remittances they bring into the country.  Our results are positive for the net benefits relative to costs.  Our results suggest that (i) there may be room for creative thinking about the possibility that the brain drain could provide mechanisms for dramatic increases in education levels within African nations; and (ii) by at least one metric, spending by African nations on higher education in this period yielded positive returns on the investment.  Our results on the individual decision problem resolve a paradox in the returns to education literature which finds low returns to tertiary education""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Fuel tax incidence and supply conditions,Economic theory,"""The incidence of taxes on consumers and producers plays a central role in evaluating energy tax policy, yet the literature testing the main predictions of the tax incidence model is sparse.  In this paper, we examine the pass-through rate of state gasoline and diesel taxes to retail prices, and importantly we estimate the dependence of pass-through on factors constraining the gasoline and diesel supply chains.  We consider several factors that alter the elasticity of supply, including within state heterogeneity in gasoline content requirements, refinery capacity utilization, inventory constraints, and variation in the demand for untaxed uses of diesel.  In general, we find that in periods of time when the supply chain is constrained, and the constraint is plausibly unrelated to shifts in demand, the pass-through rate of fuel taxes declines.  We describe several potential implications for tax policy, including tax breaks during peak driving season and during times of supply disruptions such as after major hurricanes""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A roy model of social interactions,Economic theory,"""We develop a Roy model of social interactions in which individuals sort into peer groups based on comparative advantage.  Two key results emerge: First, when comparative advantage is the guiding principle of peer group organization, the effect of moving a student into an environment with higher-achieving peers depends on where in the ability distribution she falls and the effective wages that clear the social market.  In this sense our model may rationalize the widely varying estimates of peer effects found in the literature without casting group behavior as an externality in agents' objective functions.  Second, since a student's comparative advantage is typically unobserved, the theory implies that important determinants of individual choice operate through the error term and may, even under random assignment, be correlated with the regressor of interest.  As a result, linear in means estimates of peer effects are not identified.  We show that the model's testable prediction in the presence of this confounding issue-an individual's ordinal rank predicts her behavior, ceteris paribus-is borne out in two data sets""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
When a nudge isn't enough defaults and saving among low-income tax filers /,Economic theory,"""Recent evidence suggests that the default options implicit in economic choices (e.g., 401(k) savings by white-collar workers) have extraordinarily large effects on decision-making.  This study presents a field experiment that evaluates the effect of defaults on savings among a highly policy-relevant population: low-income tax filers.  In the control condition, tax filers could choose (i.e., opt in) to receive some of their federal tax refund in the form of U.S.  Savings Bonds.  In the treatment condition, a fraction of the tax refund was automatically directed to U.S.  Savings Bonds unless tax filers actively chose another allocation.  We find that the opt-out default had no impact on savings behavior.  Furthermore, our treatment estimate is sufficiently precise to reject effects as small as one-fifth of the participation effects found in the 401(k) literature.  Ancillary evidence suggests that this ""nudge"" was ineffective in part because the low-income tax filers in our study had targeted plans to spend their refunds.  These results suggest that choice architecture based on defaults may be less effective in certain policy-relevant settings, particularly where intentions are strong""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Estimating turning points using large data sets,Economic theory,"""Dating business cycles entails ascertaining economy-wide turning points.  Broadly speaking, there are two approaches in the literature.  The first approach, which dates to Burns and Mitchell (1946), is to identify turning points individually in a large number of series, then to look for a common date that could be called an aggregate turning point.  The second approach, which has been the focus of more recent academic and applied work, is to look for turning points in a few, or just one, aggregate.  This paper examines these two approaches to the identification of turning points.  We provide a nonparametric definition of a turning point (an estimand) based on a population of time series.  This leads to estimators of turning points, sampling distributions, and standard errors for turning points based on a sample of series.  We consider both simple random sampling and stratified sampling.  The empirical part of the analysis is based on a data set of 270 disaggregated monthly real economic time series for the U.S., 1959-2010""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The contribution of human capital to China's economic growth,Economic theory,"""This paper develops a human capital measure in the sense of Schultz (1960) and then reevaluates the contribution of human capital to China's economic growth.  The results indicate that human capital plays a much more important role in China's economic growth than available literature suggests, 38.1% of economic growth over 1978-2008, and even higher for 1999-2008.  In addition, because human capital formation accelerated following the major educational expansion increases after 1999 (college enrollment in China increased nearly fivefold between 1997 and 2007) while growth rates of GDP are little changed over the period after 1999, total factor productivity increases fall if human capital is used in growth accounting as we suggest.  TFP, by our calculations, contributes 16.92% of growth between 1978 and 2008, but this contribution is -7.03% between 1999 and 2008.  Negative TFP growth along with the high contribution of physical and human capital to economic growth seem to suggest that there have been decreased in the efficiency of inputs usage in China or worsened misallocation of physical and human capital in recent years.  These results underscore the importance of efficient use of human capital, as well as the volume of human capital creation, in China's growth strategy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Commodity prices, commodity currencies, and global economic developments",Economic theory,"""In this paper we seek to produce forecasts of commodity price movements that can systematically improve on naive statistical benchmarks, and revisit the forecasting performance of changes in commodity currencies as efficient predictors of commodity prices, a view emphasized in the recent literature.  In addition, we consider different types of factor-augmented models that use information from a large data set containing a variety of indicators of supply and demand conditions across major developed and developing countries.  These factor-augmented models use either standard principal components or partial least squares (PLS) regression to extract dynamic factors from the data set.  Our forecasting analysis considers ten alternative indices and sub-indices of spot prices for three different commodity classes across different periods.  We find that the exchange rate-based model and especially the PLS factor-augmented model are more prone to outperform the naive statistical benchmarks.  However, across our range of commodity price indices we are not able to generate out-of-sample forecasts that, on average, are systematically more accurate than predictions based on a random walk or autoregressive specifications""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A shred of credible evidence on the long run elasticity of labor supply,Economic theory,"""Virtually all public policies regarding taxation and the redistribution of income rely on explicit or implicit assumptions about the long run effect of wages rates on labor supply.  The available estimates of the wage elasticity of male labor supply in the literature have varied between -0.2 and 0.2, implying that permanent wage increases have relatively small, poorly determined effects on labor supplied.  The variation in existing estimates calls for a simple, natural experiment in which men can change their hours of work, and in which wages have been exogenously and permanently changed.  We introduce a panel data set of taxi drivers who choose their own hours, and who experienced two exogenous permanent fare increases instituted by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, and we use these data to fit a simple structural labor supply function.  Our estimates suggest that the elasticity of labor supply is about -0.2, implying that income effects dominate substitution effects in the long run labor supply of males""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How substitutable is natural capital ?,Finance,"""One of the recurring themes in the sustainability literature has been the legitimacy of using an economic framework to account for natural resources.  This paper examines the potential for substituting between different inputs in the generation of income, where the inputs include natural resources such as land and energy resources.  A nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function is used to allow flexibility in the estimated elasticities of substitution.  Also, with this specification, natural resources and other inputs are combined in different levels of the function, thus allowing for different levels of substitutability.  Institutional and economic indicators are also incorporated in the production function estimated.  Results show that the elasticities derived from functions involving land resources were generally around one or greater, implying a fairly high degree of substitutability.  Furthermore, changes in trade openness and private sector investment have a statistically significant and direct relationship with income generation.  No statistically significant relationship between income and any of the institutional indicators was found. ""--World Bank web site."
Education and nonmarket outcomes,Economic theory,"""I explore the effects of education on nonmarket outcomes from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.  Examples of outcomes considered include general consumption patterns at a moment in time, savings and the rate of growth of consumption over time, own (adult) health and inputs into the production of own health, fertility, and child quality or well-being reflected by their health and cognitive development.  I pay a good deal of attention to the effects of education on health because they are the two most important sources of human capital: knowledge capital and health capital.  There is a large literature addressing the nature of their complementarities.  In the conceptual foundation section, I consider models in which education has productive efficiency and allocative efficiency effects.  I then modify these frameworks to allow for the endogenous nature of schooling decisions, so that observed schooling effects can be traced in part to omitted ""third variables"" such as an orientation towards the future.  An additional complication is that schooling may contribute to a future orientation.  The empirical review provides a good deal of evidence for the proposition that the education effects are causal but is less conclusive with regard to the identification of specific mechanisms""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
DSGE models of high exchange-rate volatility and low pass-through,Finance,"""This paper develops a quantitative, dynamic, open-economy model which endogenously generates high exchange rate volatility, whereas a low degree of pass-through stems from both nominal rigidities (in the form of local currency pricing) and price discrimination.  We model real exchange rate volatility in response to real shocks by reconsidering and extending two approaches suggested by the quantitative literature (one by Backus Kehoe and Kydland [1995], the other by Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan [2003]), within a common framework with incomplete markets and segmented domestic economies.  Our model accounts for a variable degree of ERPT over different horizons.  In the short run, we find that a very small amount of nominal rigidities--consistent with the evidence in Bils and Klenow [2004]--lowers the elasticity of import prices at border and consumer level to 27% and 13%, respectively.  Still, exchange rate depreciation worsens the terms of trade -- in accord with the evidence stressed by Obstfeld and Rogoff [2000].

"Roughing it up including jump components in the measurement, modeling, and forecasting of return volatility /",Economic theory,"""A rapidly growing literature has documented important improvements in financial return volatility measurement and forecasting via use of realized variation measures constructed from high-frequency returns coupled with simple modeling procedures.  Building on recent theoretical results in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2004a, 2005) for related bi-power variation measures, the present paper provides a practical and robust framework for non-parametrically measuring the jump component in asset return volatility.  In an application to the DM/$ exchange rate, the S&P500 market index, and the 30-year U.S.  Treasury bond yield, we find that jumps are both highly prevalent and distinctly less persistent than the continuous sample path variation process.  Moreover, many jumps appear directly associated with specific macroeconomic news announcements.  Separating jump from non-jump movements in a simple but sophisticated volatility forecasting model, we find that almost all of the predictability in daily, weekly, and monthly return volatilities comes from the non-jump component.  Our results thus set the stage for a number of interesting future econometric developments and important financial applications by separately modeling, forecasting, and pricing the continuous and jump components of the total return variation process""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Who bears the corporate tax? a review of what we know /,Economic theory,"""This paper reviews what we know from economic theory and evidence about who bears the burden of the corporate income tax.  Among the lessons from the recent literature are: 1.  For a variety of reasons, shareholders may bear a certain portion of the corporate tax burden.  In the short run, they may be unable to shift taxes on corporate capital.  Even in the long run, they may be unable to shift taxes attributable to a discount on ""old"" capital, taxes on rents, or taxes that simply reduce the advantages of corporate ownership.  Thus, the distribution of share ownership remains empirically quite relevant to corporate tax incidence analysis, though attributing ownership is itself a challenging exercise.  2.  One-dimensional incidence analysis -- distributing the corporate tax burden over a representative cross-section of the population -- can be relatively uninformative about who bears the corporate tax burden, because it misses the element timing.  3.  It is more meaningful to analyze the incidence of corporate tax changes than of the corporate tax in its entirety, because different components of the tax have different incidence and incidence relates to the path of the economy over time, not just in a single year""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A survey of securities laws and enforcement,Finance,"""Lopez-de-Silanes examines the theoretical and empirical literature pertaining to securities laws and their enforcement by regulators and courts to establish what is known and what is yet unclear.  Recent empirical research in the field has established that law matters.  Mandatory disclosure requirements, insider trading laws, safeguards against self-dealing transactions, adequate regulatory powers, and simple laws that are easily enforced aid in the development of capital markets.  The debate is now focused on identifying which components of securities laws matter most and on what the optimal regulatory framework for each country should be.  Although public enforcement of securities laws is important, the author finds that the largest impact comes from aspects of the law that facilitate private enforcement.  This means that the development of capital markets depends crucially on creating laws that facilitate enforcement and improving court procedures that allow for a more efficient dispute resolution.

The high-frequency effects of U.S. macroeconomic data releases on prices and trading activity in the global interdealer foreign exchange market,Finance,"""We introduce a new high-frequency foreign exchange dataset from EBS (Electronic Broking Service) that includes trading volume in the global interdealer spot market, data not previously available to researchers.  The data also gives live transactable quotes, rather than the indicative quotes that have been used in most previous high frequency foreign exchange analysis.  We describe intraday volume and volatility patterns in euro-dollar and dollar-yen trading.  We study the effects of scheduled U.S.  macroeconomic data releases, first confirming the finding of recent literature that the conditional mean of the exchange rate responds very quickly to the unexpected component of data releases.  We next study the effects of data releases on trading volumes.  News releases cause volume to rise, and to remain elevated for a longer period.  However, in contrast to the result for the level of the exchange rate, even if the data release is entirely in line with expectations, we find that there is still typically a large pickup in trading volume""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Ramsey monetary policy and international relative prices,Finance,"""We analyze welfare maximizing monetary policy in a dynamic two-country model with price stickiness and imperfect competition.  In this context, a typical terms of trade externality affects policy interaction between independent monetary authorities.  Unlike the existing literature, we remain consistent to a public finance approach by an explicit consideration of all the distortions that are relevant to the Ramsey planner.  This strategy entails two main advantages.  First, it allows an accurate characterization of optimal policy in an economy that evolves around a steady-state which is not necessarily efficient.  Second, it allows to describe a full range of alternative dynamic equilibria when price setters in both countries are completely forward-looking and households preferences are not restricted.  In this context, we study optimal policy both in the long-run and along a dynamic path, and we compare optimal commitment policy under Nash competition and under cooperation.  By deriving a second order accurate solution to the policy functions, we also characterize the welfare gains from international policy cooperation""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
A unified framework for pro-poor growth analysis,Finance,"""Starting with a general impact indicator as an evaluation criterion, Essama-Nssah offers an integrative framework for a unified discussion of various concepts and measures of pro-poor growth emerging from the current literature.  He shows that whether economic growth is considered pro-poor depends fundamentally on the choice of evaluative weights.  In addition, the author's framework leads to a new indicator of the rate of pro-poor growth that can be interpreted as the equally distributed equivalent growth rate.  This is a distribution-adjusted rate of growth that depends on the chosen level of inequality aversion.  Illustrations based on data for Indonesia in the 1990s show a strong link between growth and poverty reduction in that country.  A decomposition of the observed poverty outcomes reveals the extent to which changes in inequality have blunted the poverty impacts of both growth and contraction.  Finally, the results also demonstrate that absolute and relative indicators of pro-poor growth can lead to conflicting conclusions from the same set of facts.

Schooling and labor market impacts of a natural policy experiment,Finance,"""Patrinos and Sakellariou use a nationally representative household survey to estimate returns to schooling in Venezuela from instrumental variables based on a supply-side intervention in the education market.  These estimates apply to a subgroup of liquidity-constrained individuals, in the spirit of the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) literature.  Returns to schooling estimates which apply to a subgroup of individuals affected by the policy intervention may be more interesting from a policy perspective than the return to the 'average' individual.  The authors use an instrument based on the 1980 education reform (the Organic Law of Education) which provided for nine years of compulsory basic education.  They also obtain alternative estimates using father's education as an instrument, in an attempt to derive high and low estimates of returns to schooling in Venezuela.  The estimates are consistent with recent findings suggesting that the effect of education, at least for certain subgroups affected by a policy intervention, is as large or larger than what is suggested by OLS estimates.

"The less volatile U.S. economy a Bayesian investigation of timing, breadth and potential explanations /",Finance,"""Using Bayesian tests for a structural break at an unknown break date, we search for a volatility reduction within the post-war sample for the growth rates of U.S.  aggregate and disaggregate real GDP.  We find that the growth rate of aggregate real GDP has been less volatile since the early 1980's, and that this volatility reduction is concentrated in the cyclical component of real GDP.  The growth rates of many of the broad production sectors of real GDP display similar reductions in volatility, suggesting the aggregate volatility reduction does not have a narrow source.  We also find a large volatility reduction in aggregate final sales mirroring that in aggregate real GDP.  We contrast this evidence to an existing literature documenting an aggregate volatility reduction that is shared by only one narrow sub-component, the production of durable goods, and is not present in final sales.  In addition to the volatility reduction in real GDP, we document structural breaks in the volatility and persistence of inflation and interest rates occurring over a similar time frame as the volatility reduction in real GDP""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Elections, special interests, and the fiscal costs of financial crisis",Finance,"""Keefer proposes a new approach to explain why the costs of crisis are greater in some countries than in others.  He begins with the premise that many crises result from the willingness of politicians to cater to special interests at the expense of broad social interests.  A parsimonious model predicts that the less costly it is for average citizens to expel politicians, the more veto players there are; the less important are exogenous shocks, and the more difficult it is for politicians and special interests to forge credible agreements, the lower the costs of crisis are.  Though these predictions differ from those in the literature, empirical evidence presented shows that they explain the fiscal costs of financial crisis, even after controlling for the financial sector policies believed to contribute most to the efficient prevention and resolution of financial crisis.

Trade and child labor a general equilibrium analysis /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper augments the existing literature on trade and child labor by exploring the effects of terms of trade changes in the context of a three good general equilibrium model, where one of the goods is a non-traded good. We find that under quasi-linear preferences the effect of the terms of trade on child labor depends critically on the pattern of substitutability (or complementarity) in the excess demand functions between the export good and the non-traded good. We extend the analysis to the case of homothetic preferences and find that the basic result is somewhat modified in a context where the marginal utility of income is affected by the terms of trade. We also extend the analysis to the case where factors move freely between the three goods as in a Heckscher-Ohlin type framework. Finally, we show that a balanced budget policy of taxing the education of skilled families and subsidizing the education of unskilled families must reduce child labor without any impact on aggregate welfare""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The Chinese approach to capital inflows patterns and possible explanations /,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we adopt a cross-country perspective to examine the evolution of capital flows into China, both in terms of volumes and composition.  China's inflows have generally been dominated by foreign direct investment (FDI), a pattern that appears to be favorable in light of the recent literature on the experiences of developing countries with financial globalization.  We provide a detailed documentation of the evolution of China's capital controls, a proximate determinant of the pattern of capital inflows.  We also discuss a number of other intriguing hypotheses that attempt to capture the ""deeper"" causes underlying China's approach to capital flows.  In particular, we argue that some popular mercantilist-type arguments are inconsistent with the facts.  We also analyze the recent rapid rise of China's international reserves and discuss its implications.  Contrary to some popular perceptions, the dramatic surge in foreign exchange reserves since 2001 is mainly attributable to non-FDI capital inflows, rather than current account surpluses or FDI""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The world distribution of income and income inequality,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This review covers a range of measures and methods frequently employed in empirical analysis of global income inequality and global income distribution. Different determinant factors along with quantification of their impacts and empirical results from different case studies are presented. These results are further contrasted to those obtained based on the World Income Inequality Database. A number of issues crucial to the studies of global income inequality are addressed. These are the concepts, measurement and decomposition of inequality, the world distribution of income and inequality measured at different levels of aggregation: global, international and intra-national. We analyse income at each of the three levels, discuss the benefit and limitations of each approach and present empirical results found in the literature and compare it with those based on the World Income Inequality Database.

Estimating risk preferences from deductible choice,Economic theory,"""We use a large data set of deductible choices in auto insurance contracts to estimate the distribution of risk preferences in our sample.  To do so, we develop a structural econometric model, which accounts for adverse selection by allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in both risk (probability of an accident) and risk aversion.  Ex-post claim information separately identifies the marginal distribution of risk, while the joint distribution of risk and risk aversion is identified by the deductible choice.  We find that individuals in our sample have on average an estimated absolute risk aversion which is higher than other estimates found in the literature.  Using annual income as a measure of wealth, we find an average two-digit coefficient of relative risk aversion.  We also find that women tend to be more risk averse than men, that proxies for income and wealth are positively related to absolute risk aversion, that unobserved heterogeneity in risk preferences is higher relative to that of risk, and that unobserved risk is positively correlated with unobserved risk aversion.  Finally, we use our results for counterfactual exercises that assess the profitability of insurance contracts under various assumptions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trade responses to geographic frictions a decomposition using micro-data /,Economic theory,"""A large literature has shown that geographic frictions reduce trade, but has not clarified precisely why.  We provide insights into why such frictions matter by examining which parts of trade these frictions reduce most.  Using data that tracks manufacturers' shipments within the United States on an exceptionally fine grid, we find that the pattern of shipments is extremely localized.  Shipments within 5-digit zip codes, which have a median radius of just 4 miles, are 3 times larger than shipments outside the zip code.  We decompose aggregate shipments into extensive and intensive margins, and show that distance and other frictions reduce aggregate trade values primarily by reducing the number of commodities shipped and the number of establishments shipping.  We consider two broad reasons for these facts and conclude that trade in intermediate goods is the most likely explanation for highly localized shipments and the dominant role of the extensive margin.  In addition, we find no evidence of state-level home bias when distances are measured precisely and trade is observed over a very fine grid""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The impact on nutrition of the intrahousehold distribution of power,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The distribution of income within the household is found to matter for the allocation of resources towards nutrition. Rural Mexican households do not pool income, nor do they attain a Pareto-efficient allocation of resources. In contrast to what is commonly done in the literature, I do not assume that only the head of household and his wife share the decision-making. In particular, I present a new test of the unitary model in the context of extended families, which acknowledges that any household member may participate to the decision-making as long as he or she earns some income. I find that a change in the number of income earners is associated with a change in food calorie consumption controlling for the change in household size and household income. Both the number and identities of income earners matter in the extended family. In particular, when a female household member starts earning income, food consumption increases substantively. When it is a male household member who starts earning income, it decreases substantively""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Institution building and growth in transition economies,Finance,"""Drawing on the recent literature on economic institutions and the origins of economic development, the authors offer a political economy explanation of why institution building has varied so much across transition economies.  They identify dependence on natural resources and the historical experience of these countries during socialism as major determinants of institution building during transition by influencing the political structure and process during the initial years.  Their empirical analysis shows that countries that are more reliant on natural resources and spent a longer time under socialist governments are more likely to see former communists remain in power and to start the transition process with less open political systems, with negative repercussions for the development of market-compatible institutions.  Using natural resource reliance and the years under socialism to extract the exogenous component of institution building, the authors also show the importance of institutions in explaining the variation in economic development and growth across transition economies during the first decade of transition.

"Migration, trade, and foreign investment in Mexico",Finance,"""Part of the rationale for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was that it would increase trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, creating jobs and reducing migration to the United States.  Since poor data on illegal flows to the United States make direct measurement difficult, Aroca and Maloney instead evaluate the mechanism behind these predictions using data on migration within Mexico where the census data permit careful analysis.  They offer the first specifications for migration within Mexico, incorporating measures of cost of living, amenities, and networks.  Contrary to much of the literature, labor market variables enter very significantly and as predicted once the authors control for possible credit constraint effects.  Greater exposure to FDI and trade deters out-migration with the effects working partly through the labor market.  Finally, the authors generate some tentative inferences about the impact on increased FDI on Mexico-U.S.  migration.  On average, a doubling of FDI inflows leads to a 1.5-2 percent fall in migration.

How well do institutional theories explain firms' perceptions of property rights?,Finance,"""The authors examine how well several institutional and firm-level factors and their interactions explain firms' perceptions of property rights protection.  Their sample includes private and public firms that vary in size from very small to large in 62 countries.  Together, the institutional theories they investigate account for approximately 70 percent of the country-level variation, indicating that the literature is addressing first-order factors.  Firm-level characteristics such as legal organization and ownership structure are comparable to institutional factors in explaining variation in property rights protection.  A country's legal origin and formalism index predict property rights variation better than its openness to international trade, its religion, its ethnic diversity, natural endowments or its political system.  However, these results are driven by the inclusion of former socialist economies in the sample.  When the authors exclude the former socialist economies, legal origin explains considerably less than openness to trade and endowments.  Examining a broader set of variables for robustness, they again find that when they exclude former socialist countries, legal origin explains comparatively little of the variation in perceptions of judicial efficiency, corruption, taxes and regulation, street crime, and financing.

Determinants of city growth in Brazil,Finance,"""The authors examine the determinants of Brazilian city growth between 1970 and 2000.  They consider a model of a city that combines aspects of standard urban economics and the new economic geography literatures.  For the empirical analysis, the authors construct a dataset of 123 Brazilian agglomerations and estimate aspects of the demand and supply side, as well as a reduced form specification that describes city sizes and their growth.  Their main findings are that increases in rural population supply, improvements in interregional transport connectivity, and education attainment of the labor force have strong impacts on city growth.  They also find that local crime and violence, measured by homicide rates, impinge on growth.  In contrast, a higher share of private sector industrial capital in the local economy stimulates growth.  Using the residuals from the growth estimation, the authors also find that cities that better administer local land use and zoning laws have higher growth.  Finally, their policy simulations show that diverting transport investments from large cities toward secondary cities does not provide significant gains in terms of national urban performance.

The industrial organization of markets with two-sided platforms,Economic theory,"""Two-sided platforms (2SPs) cater to two or more distinct groups of customers, facilitating value-creating interactions between them.  The village market and the village matchmaker were 2SPs; eBay and Match.com are more recent examples.  Other examples include payment card systems, magazines, shopping malls, and personal computer operating systems.  Building on the seminal work of Rochet and Tirole (2003), a rapidly growing literature has illuminated the economic principles that apply to 2SPs generally.  One key result is that 2SPs may find it profit-maximizing to charge prices for one customer group that are below marginal cost or even negative, and such skewed pricing pattern is prevalent, although not universal, in industries that appear to be based on 2SPs.  Over the years, courts have also recognized that certain industries, notably payment card systems and newspapers, now understood to be based on 2SPs, are governed by unusual economic relationships.  This chapter provides an introduction to the economics of 2SPs and its application to several competition policy issues""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Classic monopsony or new monopsony? searching for evidence in nursing labor markets /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The market for hospital registered nurses (RNs) is often offered as an example of ""classic"" monopsony, while a ""new"" monopsony literature emphasizes firm labor supply being upward-sloping for reasons other than market structure. Using data from several sources, we explore the relationship between wages and measures of classic and new monopsony. Micro wage data for 1993-2002 provide little evidence of classic monopsonistic outcomes in the long run, the relative wages of RNs in 240 U.S. labor markets being largely uncorrelated with market size or employer concentration. A short-run relationship is found, with RN wages declining in markets with increased hospital system concentration. Measures of new monopsony use data on mobility to proxy inverse supply elasticities. No relationship is found between these measure and nursing wages, but evidence supporting new monopsony is found for women elsewhere in the labor market. RNs display greater inter-employer mobility than do women (or men) in general. Two conclusions follow. First, evidence of upward sloping labor supply need not imply monopsonistic outcomes. Second, nursing should not be held up as a prototypical example of monopsony""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Teacher shocks and student learning evidence from Zambia /,Finance,"""A large literature examines the link between shocks to households and the educational attainment of children.  The authors use new data to estimate the impact of shocks to teachers on student learning in mathematics and English.  Using absenteeism in the 30 days preceding the survey as a measure of these shocks they find large impacts: A 5 percent increase in the teacher's absence rate reduces learning by 4 to 8 percent of average gains over the year.  This reduction in learning achievement likely reflects both the direct effect of increased absenteeism and the indirect effects of less lesson preparation and lower teaching quality when in class.  The authors document that health problems-primarily teachers' own illness and the illnesses of their family members-account for more than 60 percent of teacher absences; not surprising in a country struggling with an HIV/AIDS epidemic.  The relationship between shocks to teachers and student learning suggests that households are unable to substitute adequately for teaching inputs.  Excess teaching capacity that allows for the greater use of substitute teachers could lead to larger gains in student learning. ""--World Bank web site."
Recent trends in resource sharing among the poor,Economic theory,"""Motivated in part by the dramatic changes in the United States economy and public assistance policies, many researchers have examined the changes in the resources of the low-income population over the last two decades, with particular attention paid to income from earnings and public assistance programs.  One source of income that has received comparatively little attention is income from private transfers.  However, private transfers may be a key source of support for low-income individuals, especially for those who have had little attachment to the labor force or who have experienced reductions in public assistance.  In this paper, we provide a conceptual discussion of private transfers drawing on several related literatures and provide new empirical evidence regarding the significance of private of transfers as a source income.  We find that private transfers are an important source of income for many less-skilled households, the contribution of private transfers to total income has increased over time, and shared living arrangements are a common mechanism for providing assistance""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Understanding the impact of oil shocks,Economic theory,"""This paper provides new empirical evidence on and theoretical support for the close link between oil prices and aggregate macroeconomic performance in the 1970s.  Although this link has been well documented in the empirical literature and is further confirmed in this paper, standard economic models are not able to replicate this link when actual oil prices are used to simulate the models.  In particular, standard models cannot explain the depth of the recession in 1974-75 and the strong revival in 1976-78 based on the oil price movements in that period.  This paper argues that a missing multiplier-accelerator mechanism from standard models may hold the key.  This multiplier-accelerator mechanism not only exacerbated the impact of the oil shocks in 1973-74 but also helped create the temporary recovery in 1976-78.  This paper derives the missing multiplier-accelerator mechanism from externalities in general equilibrium.  Our calibrated model can explain both the recession in 1974-75 and the revival in 1976-78""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Information dynamics and equilibrium multiplicity in global games of regime change,Economic theory,"""Global games of regime change - 2013 that is, coordination games of incomplete information in which a status quo is abandoned once a sufficiently large fraction of agents attacks it - have been used to study crises phenomena such as currency attacks, bank runs, debt crises, and political change.  We extend the static benchmark examined in the literature by allowing agents to accumulate information over time and take actions in many periods.  It is shown that dynamics may lead to multiple equilibria under the same information assumptions that guarantee uniqueness in the static benchmark.  Multiplicity originates in the interaction between the arrival of information over time and the endogenous change in beliefs induced by the knowledge that the regime survived past attacks.  This interaction also generates interesting equilibrium properties, such as the possibility that fundamentals predict the eventual regime outcome but not the timing or the number of attacks, or that dynamics alternate between crises and phases of tranquility without changes in fundamentals""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Predicting the effects of Federal Reserve policy in a sticky-price model an analytical approach /,Economic theory,"""In this paper, I characterize equilibria for a sticky-price model in which Federal Reserve policy is an interest-rate rule similar to that described in Taylor (1993).  For standard preferences and technologies used in the literature, the model predicts that the nominal interest rate is negatively serially correlated, and that shocks to interest rates imply a potentially large but short-lived response in output.  Shocks to government spending and technology lead to persistent changes in output but the percentage change in output is predicted to be smaller than the percentage changes in spending or technology.  I compare the model's predictions to data using innovations backed out from estimated processes for interest rates, government spending, and technology shocks.  These comparisons confirm the theoretical findings.  In response to observed changes in government spending and technology, the model predicts a path for output that is much smoother than the data and much smoother than that predicted by non-sticky price models""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site."
"Poverty, political freedom, and the roots of terrorism",Economic theory,"""This article provides an empirical investigation of the determinants of terrorism at the country level.  In contrast with the previous literature on this subject, which focuses on transnational terrorism only, I use a new measure of terrorism that encompasses both domestic and transnational terrorism.  In line with the results of some recent studies, this article shows that terrorist risk is not significantly higher for poorer countries, once the effects of other country-specific characteristics such as the level of political freedom are taken into account.  Political freedom is shown to explain terrorism, but it does so in a non-monotonic way: countries in some intermediate range of political freedom are shown to be more prone to terrorism than countries with high levels of political freedom or countries with highly authoritarian regimes.  This result suggests that, as experienced recently in Iraq and previously in Spain and Russia, transitions from an authoritarian regime to a democracy may be accompanied by temporary increases in terrorism.  Finally, the results suggest that geographic factors are important to sustain terrorist activities""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Market structure and productivity A concrete example /,Economic theory,"""Many studies have documented large and persistent productivity differences across producers, even within narrowly defined industries.  This paper both extends and departs from the past literature, which focused on technological explanations for these differences, by proposing that demand-side features also play a role in creating the observed productivity variation.  The specific mechanism investigated here is the effect of spatial substitutability in the product market.  When producers are densely clustered in a market, it is easier for consumers to switch between suppliers (making the market in a certain sense more competitive).  Relatively inefficient producers find it more difficult to operate profitably as a result.  Substitutability increases truncate the productivity distribution from below, resulting in higher minimum and average productivity levels as well as less productivity dispersion.  The paper presents a model that makes this process explicit and empirically tests it using data from U.S.  ready-mixed concrete plants, taking advantage of geographic variation in substitutability created by the industry's high transport costs.  The results support the model's predictions and appear robust.  Markets with high demand density for ready-mixed concrete and thus high concrete plant densities have higher lower-bound and average productivity levels and exhibit less productivity dispersion among their producers""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Do stock prices really reflect fundamental values? the case of reits /,Economic theory,"""Real estate investment trust (REIT) stock prices deviate substantially from net asset values (NAV).  Using REIT data since 1990, we find large positive excess returns to a strategy of buying stocks that trade at a discount to NAV, and shorting stocks trading at a premium to NAV.  Estimated alphas from this strategy are between 0.9% and 1.8% per month, with little risk.  Trading costs and short-sale constraints are not prohibitive and the results strengthen when we control for differences in liquidity or the extent of institutional ownership.  We find that some variation in P/NAV makes sense, as premiums are positively related to recent and future NAV growth.  However, there appears to be too much volatility in P/NAV, giving rise to potential profits from short-term mean reversion.  The closed-end fund literature has some similar findings on stock price deviations from fundamental value, but compared to closed-end funds REITs are much larger and have much higher insider and institutional ownership.  These differences suggest that REIT premiums and discounts reflect more than just small investor sentiment, which is a common explanation of why closed-end fund prices deviate from their fundamental value""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Some new variance bounds for asset prices,Economic theory,"""When equity prices are determined as the discounted sum of current and expected future dividends, Shiller (1981) and LeRoy and Porter (1981) derived a relationship between the variance of the price of equities, p(t), and the variance of the ex post realized discounted sum of current and future dividends: p*(t): Var(p*(t))>= Var(p(t)).  The literature has long since recognized that this variance bound is valid only when dividends follow a stationary process.  Others, notably West (1988), derive variance bounds that apply when dividends are nonstationary.  West shows that the variance in innovations in p(t) must be less than the variance of innovations in a forecast of the discounted sum of current and future dividends constructed by the econometrician, p^(t).  Here we derive a new variance bound when dividends are stationary or have a unit root, that sheds light on the discussion in the 1980s of the Shiller variance bound: Var(p(t)-p(t-1)) >= Var(p*(t)-p*(t-1))! We also derive a variance bound related to the West bound: Var(p^(t)-p^(t-1)) >= Var(p(t)-p(t-1))""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Portfolio diversification and city agglomeration,Economic theory,"""We relate the degree of investor portfolio focus to the broader urban economic context of the household.  Using a detailed panel of investors in Sweden over the period 1995 to 2000, we find that the level of investor diversification, as measured by number of stocks in the portfolio and by the average correlation among holdings, is partially explained by city industrial characteristics.  We find that rural portfolios are more diversified than urban portfolios and that portfolio diversification is characterized by factors associated with urban growth.  We consider a number of theories to explain investor focus, including behavioral biases, real and perceived informational advantage, local social competition and hedging of non-tradable risk.  We find little evidence to support social and hedging motives to explain the lack of portfolio diversification, and some evidence in favor of perceived informational advantage in an urban setting.  We attribute this evidence as support for the broader 'knowledge spillover' processes documented in the recent urban economics literature.  Portfolio effects may be added to the list of factors that define and differentiate urbanism""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Localization and corruption Panacea or Pandora's box? /,Finance,"""An extensive literature on the relationship between decentralization (or localization) and corruption has developed in recent years.  While some authors argue that there is a positive relationship between decentralization and corruption, others claim that decentralization in fact leads to a reduction in the level of corruption.  This important policy question has not yet been laid to rest since previous empirical work simply uses eclectic regressions and lacks a conceptual framework to discover the root causes of corruption.  Gurgur and Shah attempt to fill this void by presenting a framework in identifying the drivers of corruption both conceptually and empirically to isolate the role of centralized decisionmaking on corruption.  The following results emerge: * For a sample of 30 countries (developing and industrial), corruption is caused by a lack of service orientation in the public sector, weak democratic institutions, economic isolation (closed economy), colonial past, internal bureaucratic controls, and centralized decisionmaking.  * Decentralization is found to have a negative impact on corruption, with the effect being stronger in unitary than in federal countries.

We obtain estimates of residual risk (growth uncertainty) at various horizons from regressions of country-specific deviations from world growth on a wide set of variables in the information set.  Since this residual risk can be entirely hedged, we use it to obtain a measure of welfare gain that can be achieved by a representative country.  We find that nations can reap very large benefits from engaging in such risksharing arrangements.  Using post-war data, the gain for a 35-year horizon, corresponding to an equivalent permanent increase in consumption, is 6.6% when based on a set of 49 countries, and 1.5% when based on 21 OECD countries.  Using historical data from 1870 to 1990, we find that the potential gain for a 120-year horizon ranges from 4.9% for a small set of rich countries to 16.5% for a broad set of 24 countries""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
National sovereignty in an interdependent world,Economic theory,"""What are the sovereign rights of nations in an interdependent world, and to what extent do these rights stand in the way of achieving important international objectives? These two questions rest at the heart of contemporary debate over the role and design of international institutions as well as growing tension between globalization and the preservation of national sovereignty.  In this paper, we propose answers to these two questions.  We do so by first developing formal definitions of national sovereignty that capture features of sovereignty emphasized in the political science literature.  We then utilize these definitions to describe the degree and nature of national sovereignty possessed by governments in a benchmark (Nash) world in which there exist no international agreements of any kind.  And with national sovereignty characterized in this benchmark world, we then evaluate the extent to which national sovereignty is compromised by international agreements with specific design features.  In this way, we delineate the degree of tension between national sovereignty and international objectives and describe how that tension can be minimized and in principle at times even eliminated through careful institutional design""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Book-tax conformity for corporate income an introduction to the issues /,Economic theory,"""This paper discusses the issues surrounding the proposals to conform financial accounting income and taxable income.  The two incomes diverged in the late 1990s with financial accounting income becoming increasingly greater than taxable income through the year 2000.  While the cause of this divergence is not known for certain, many suspect that it is the result of earnings management for financial accounting and/or the tax sheltering of corporate income.  Our paper outlines the potential costs and benefits of one of the proposed ""fixes"" to the divergence: the conforming of the two incomes into one measure.  We review relevant research that sheds light on the issues surrounding conformity both in the U.S.  as well as evidence from other countries that have more closely aligned book and taxable incomes.  The extant empirical literature reveals that it is unlikely that conforming the incomes will reduce the amount of tax sheltering by corporations and that having only one measure of income will result in a loss of information to the capital markets""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Duty drawbacks, competitiveness, and growth Are duty drawbacks worth the hassle? /",Finance,"""Many countries use duty drawbacks on exports, yet they have been given little attention in the literature and there is no consensus whether countries should embrace or abandon them.  Ianchovichina asserts that the answer depends on a country's development priorities and economic conditions.  An increase in the drawback has a positive impact on export competitiveness and employment, but could lead to exports with low domestic value added.  The welfare effects of duty drawback reform are ambiguous.  An increase in the drawback is more likely to be welfare improving if the economy is small with high input tariffs, low initial drawback, low administrative costs, and leakages in the tariff collection system.  In China duty drawback removal after meeting WTO commitments will deepen domestic supply chains and improve welfare, but will hurt China's economic efficiency, export competitiveness, and real factor incomes.  Further liberalization could mitigate these negative effects.

The green Solow model,Economic theory,"""We demonstrate that a key empirical finding in environmental economics - The Environmental Kuznets Curve - and the core model of modern macroeconomics - the Solow model - are intimately related.  Once we amend the Solow model to incorporate technological progress in abatement, the EKC is a necessary by product of convergence to a sustainable growth path.  Our amended model, which we dub the Green Solow', generates an EKC relationship between both the flow of pollution emissions and income per capita, and the stock of environmental quality and income per capita.  The resulting EKC may be humped shaped or strictly declining.  We explain why current methods for estimating an EKC are likely to fail whenever they fail to account for cross-country heterogeneity in either initial conditions or deep parameters.  We then develop an alternative empirical method closely related to tests of income convergence employed in the macro literature.  Preliminary tests of the model's predictions are investigated using data from OECD countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Innovative Tokyo,Finance,"""Fujita and Hill compare and contrast Tokyo's innovation structure with the industrial districts model and the international hub model in the literature on urban and regional development.  The model embraces and yet transcends both industrial districts and international hub models.  The authors provide key elements making up the Tokyo model--organizational knowledge creation, integral and co-location systems of corporate research and development and new product development, test markets, industrial districts and clusters, participative consumer culture, continuous learning from abroad, local government policies, the national system of innovation, and the historical genesis of Tokyo in Japan's political economy.  They find that the Tokyo model of innovation will continue to evolve with the changing external environment, but fundamentally retain its main characteristics.  The lessons from the Tokyo model is that openness, a diversified industrial base, the continuing development of new industries, and an emphasis on innovation all contribute to the dynamism of a major metropolitan region.

Looking beyond the CEO executive compensation at banks /,Economic theory,"""The literature on executive compensation at banks has proceeded largely under the assumption that a single elasticity can adequately describe the sensitivity of executive pay to firm performance, but theories of performance based pay and tournament pay suggest that this assumption may be incorrect.  We test the single-elasticity assumption by comparing the components of compensation and the pay-performance relationship across banks with different characteristics and bank executives of different positions.  We find that the structure of compensation varies significantly across firms, with firm size being an important explanatory firm characteristic.  The structure of compensation also varies across executive positions, but only after controlling for differences across firms.  These patterns translate into significant differences in pay-performance relationships across firms, with size being the distinguishing firm characteristic.  Differences across executives are less robust.  There is some evidence that CEO stature enhances pay-performance sensitivity at the largest banks in our sample, but the non-base pay components of CEO compensation are apparently less performance sensitive than their labels would suggest""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Meese-Rogoff redux micro-based exchange rate forecasting /,Economic theory,"""This paper compares the true, ex-ante forecasting performance of a micro-based model against both a standard macro model and a random walk.  In contrast to existing literature, which is focused on longer horizon forecasting, we examine forecasting over horizons from one day to one month (the one-month horizon being where micro and macro analysis begin to overlap).  Over our 3-year forecasting sample, we find that the micro-based model consistently out-performs both the random walk and the macro model.  Micro-based forecasts account for almost 16 per cent of the sample variance in monthly spot rate changes.  These results provide a level of empirical validation as yet unattained by other models.  Our result that the micro-based model out-performs the macro model does not imply that macro fundamentals will never explain exchange rates.  Quite the contrary, our findings are in fact consistent with the view that the principal driver of exchange rates is standard macro fundamentals.  In Evans and Lyons (2004b)we report firm evidence that the non-public information that we exploit here for forecasting exchange rates is also useful for forecasting macro fundamentals themselves""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Income and democracy,Economic theory,"""We revisit one of the central empirical findings of the political economy literature that higher income per capita causes democracy.  Existing studies establish a strong cross-country correlation between income and democracy, but do not typically control for factors that simultaneously affect both variables.  We show that controlling for such factors by including country fixed effects removes the statistical association between income per capita and various measures of democracy.  We also present instrumental-variables using two different strategies.  These estimates also show no causal effect of income on democracy.  Furthermore, we reconcile the positive cross-country correlation between income and democracy with the absence of a causal effect of income on democracy by showing that the long-run evolution of income and democracy is related to historical factors.  Consistent with this, the positive correlation between income and democracy disappears, even without fixed effects, when we control for the historical determinants of economic and political development in a sample of former European colonies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Lifecycle consistent estimation of effect of taxes on female labor supply in the U.S. evidence from panel data /,Economic theory,"""Very few existing studies have estimated female labor supply elasticities using a U.S. panel data set, though cross-sectional studies abound. Also, most existing studies have modeled female labor supply in the U.S. in a static framework. I make an attempt to fill the gap in this literature, by estimating a lifecycle-consistent specification with taxes, in a limited dependent variable framework, on a panel of married females from the PSID. Both parametric random effects and semiparametric fixed effects methods are applied. The estimate of compensated elasticity for females in the sample is 0.63 (with a standard error of 0.14). These estimates are fairly robust to the choice of both random effects and semiparametric fixed effect estimators and also to the choice of instruments for the endogenous net wage and virtual full income. I estimate exact deadweight loss from taxes and find that deadweight loss from a 20 percent increase in the marginal tax rate is about 18 percent of tax revenue collected, evaluated at the sample mean""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site."
R&D a small contribution to productivity growth /,Economic theory,"""In this paper I evaluate the contribution of R&D investments to productivity growth.  The basis for the analysis are the free entry condition and the fact that most R&D innovations are embodied.  Free entry yields a relationship between the resources devoted to R&D and the growth rate of technology.  Since innovators are small, this relationship is not directly affected by the size of R&D externalities, or the presence of aggregate diminishing returns in R&D after controlling for the growth rate of output and the interest rate.  The embodiment of R&D-driven innovations bounds the size of the production externalities.  The resulting contribution of R&D to productivity growth in the US is smaller than three to five tenths of one percentage point.  This constitutes an upper bound for the case where innovators internalize the consequences of their R&D investments on the cost of conducting future innovations.  From a normative perspective, this analysis implies that, if the innovation technology takes the form assumed in the literature, the actual US R&D intensity may be the socially optimal""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The take up of social benefits,Economic theory,"""This paper offers a review of recent literature regarding the take up of social programs in the U.S.  and U.K.  A few general conclusions are drawn: First, take up is enhanced by automatic or default enrollment and lowered by administrative barriers, although removing individual barriers does not necessarily have much effect, suggesting that one must address the whole bundle.  Second, although it may be impossible to devise a definitive test of the stigma hypothesis, other, more concrete types of transactions costs are probably a good deal more important.  Third, although people generally have means-tested programs in the United States in mind when they discuss take up, low take up is also a problem in many non means-tested social insurance programs and in other countries.  Historically, economists have paid little attention to rules about eligibility, and virtually no attention to how these rules are enforced or made known to eligibles.  Hence, the marginal return to new data about these features of programs is likely to be high in terms of understanding take up.  In an era of social experiments, it might also prove useful to consider experimental manipulations of factors thought to influence take up""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A test for anchoring and yea-saying in experimental consumption data,Economic theory,"""In the experimental module of the AHEAD 1995 data, the sample is randomly split into respondents who get an open-ended question on the amount of total family consumption - with follow-up unfolding brackets (of the form: is consumption $X or more?) for those who answer don't know' or refuse' - and respondents who are immediately directed to unfolding brackets.  In both cases, the entry point of the unfolding bracket sequence is randomized.  These data are used to develop a nonparametric test for whether people make mistakes in answering the first bracket question, allowing for any type of selection into answering the open-ended question or not.  Two well-known types of mistakes are considered: anchoring and yea-saying (or acquiescence).  While the literature provides ample evidence that the entry point in the first bracket question serves as an anchor for follow-up bracket questions, it is less clear whether the answers to the first bracket question are already affected by anchoring.  We reject the joint hypothesis of no anchoring and no yea-saying at the entry point.  Once yea-saying is taken into account""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How should suburbs help their central cities?,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we study the question whether suburbs should help finance the core public services of their central cities.  We review three arguments that have been offered in favor of suburbs' fiscal assistance to their central cities.  First, the central city provides public services that benefit suburban residents.  Second, the central city may provide redistributive services to low-income central city residents that benefit suburbanites with redistributive preferences for such transfers.  For efficiency, suburbanites should contribute toward such services in proportion to the benefits they enjoy.  Third, the central city's private economy may be an efficient production center because of agglomeration economies, that is, increasing returns, in the production of goods and services consumed by suburban residents.  Distributive city finances--for example, rent-seeking--may undermine those economies by driving businesses or residents from the city.  Suburbanites may wish to contribute toward the costs of such fiscal redistribution if those contributions reduce the number of firms and residents leaving.  We examine the effects of suburban transfers in a structural model of a metropolitan economy that is consistent with the last of these explanations and with the city-suburban interdependence literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Private benefits and cross-listings in the United States,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we review the literature on private benefits and cross-listings in the United States.  We first discuss the alternative approaches used to measure private benefits.  We survey recent evidence documenting cross-country differences in the levels of private benefits obtained by corporate managers, as well as the country-specific factors associated with high and low private benefits.  We then explain how, by cross-listing its stock in a market with high disclosure and regulatory standards such as the United States, a firm can commit to a relatively low level of private benefits in the future.  We discuss the circumstances under which managers would choose to cross-list their stocks in the United States, when such a cross-listing has important implications for managers' private benefits.  Finally, we survey recent empirical work that tests empirical implications of this bonding view of cross-listings.  Overall, this evidence provides a compelling case that the desire to protect shareholders' rights so as to facilitate access to equity markets is one of a number of reasons why firms choose to cross-list their stocks in the United States""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Rearranging the family? income support and elderly living arrangements in a low income country /,Economic theory,"""Despite the importance of living arrangements for well-being and production, the effect of changes in household income on living arrangements is not well understood.  This study overcomes the identification problems that have limited the study of the link between income and living arrangements by exploiting a discontinuity in the benefit formula for the social pension in South Africa.  In contrast to the findings of the existing literature from wealthier populations, we find no evidence that pension income is used to maintain the independence of black elders in South Africa.  Rather, potential beneficiaries alter their household structure.  Prime working age women depart, and we observe an increase in children under 5 and young women of child-bearing age.  These shifts in co-residence patterns are consistent with a setting where prime age women have comparative advantage in work away from extended family relative to younger women.  The additional income from old age support may induce a change in living arrangements to exploit this advantage""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Fiscal policy and growth,Economic theory,"""In the literature neither taxes, government spending nor deficits are robustly correlated with economic growth when evaluated individually. The lack of correlation may arise from the inability of any single budgetary component to fully capture the stance of fiscal policy. We use pair-wise combinations of fiscal indicators to assess the relationship between fiscal policy and U.S. growth. We develop a VAR methodology for evaluating simultaneous shocks to more than one variable and use it to examine the impulse responses for simultaneous, unexpected and equivalent structural shocks to pair-wise combinations of fiscal indicators. We also exploit the identity relationship between taxes, spending and deficits and follow Sims and Zha (1998) to evaluate an unexpected structural shock to one included fiscal indicator, holding constant the other included indicator. We find that an increase in the size of federal government leads to slower economic growth, that the deficit is an unreliable indicator of the stance of fiscal policy, and that tax revenues are the most consistent indicator of fiscal policy""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site."
"State and local policy, factor markets and regional growth",Economic theory,"""A large and growing literature to explain how state and local policies affect factor markets, firm location and economic growth has developed in three distinct threads. These threads have variously emphasized how policy and natural amenities affect regional economic growth or firm location; how variations in policy and natural amenities can lead to persistent wage differentials across regions; and how regional variation in factor inputs, including public capital, affects output. In this article, we expand the modeling framework of Roback and Gyourko and Tracy to integrate these threads into a single inquiry about how state and local policies - including the provision public capital- affects factor markets and economic growth. Using the model as the basis for estimation, we find that state and local policies have a more profound influence on the private capital-to-labor ratio in a region than on private output. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the growth of government - either in the form of services or public capital - discourages private sector growth.""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site."
Private benefits of control an international comparison /,Economic theory,"""We construct a measure of the private benefits of control in 39 countries based on 412 control transactions between 1990 and 2000.  We find that the value of control ranges between 4% and +65%, with an average of 14 percent.  As predicted by theory, in countries where private benefits of control are larger capital markets are less developed, ownership is more concentrated, and privatizations are less likely to take place as public offerings.  We also analyze what institutions are most important in curbing these private benefits.  A high degree of statutory protection of minority shareholders and high degree of law enforcement are associated with lower levels of private benefits of control, but so are a high level of diffusion of the press, a high rate of tax compliance, and a high degree of product market competition.  A crude R-squared test suggests that the 'non traditional' mechanisms have at least as much explanatory power as the legal ones commonly mentioned in the literature.  In fact, in a multivariate analysis newspapers' circulation and tax compliance seem to be the dominating factors.  We advance an explanation why this might be the case""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Volatility forecasting,Economic theory,"""Volatility has been one of the most active and successful areas of research in time series econometrics and economic forecasting in recent decades.  This chapter provides a selective survey of the most important theoretical developments and empirical insights to emerge from this burgeoning literature, with a distinct focus on forecasting applications.  Volatility is inherently latent, and Section 1 begins with a brief intuitive account of various key volatility concepts.  Section 2 then discusses a series of different economic situations in which volatility plays a crucial role, ranging from the use of volatility forecasts in portfolio allocation to density forecasting in risk management.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 present a variety of alternative procedures for univariate volatility modeling and forecasting based on the GARCH, stochastic volatility and realized volatility paradigms, respectively.  Section 6 extends the discussion to the multivariate problem of forecasting conditional covariances and correlations, and Section 7 discusses volatility forecast evaluation methods in both univariate and multivariate cases.  Section 8 concludes briefly""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Optimal taxation with endogenous insurance markets,Economic theory,"""We study optimal tax policy in a dynamic private information economy with endogenous private markets.  We characterize efficient allocations and competitive equilibria.  A standard assumption in the literature is that trades are observable by all agents.  We show that in such an environment the competitive equilibrium is efficient.  The only effect of government interventions is crowding out of private insurance.  We then relax the assumption of observability of consumption and consider an environment with unobservable trades in competitive markets.  We show that efficient allocations have the property that the marginal product of capital is different from the market interest rate associated with unobservable trades.  In any competitive equilibrium without taxation, the marginal product of capital and the market interest rate are equated, so that competitive equilibria are not efficient.  Taxation of capital income can be welfare-improving because such taxation introduces a wedge between market interest rates and the marginal product of capital and allows agents to obtain better insurance in private markets.  Finally, we use plausibly calibrated numerical examples to compute optimal taxes and welfare gains and compare results to an economy with a restricted set of tax instruments, and to an economy with observable trades""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Interfirm mobility, wages, and the returns to seniority and experience in the U.S.","Industries, Land use, Labor","""Much of the research in labor economics during the 1980s and the early 1990s was devoted to the analysis of changes in the wage structure across many of the world's economies. Only recently, has research turned to the analysis of mobility in its various guises. From the life cycle perspective, decreased wage mobility and increased job instability, makes the phenomenon of increasing wage inequality more severe than it appears to be at first sight. In general, workers' wages may change through two channels: (a) return to their firm-specific human capital (seniority); or (b) inter-firm wage mobility. Our theoretical model gives rise to three equations: (1) a participation equation; (2) a wage equation; and (3) an interfirm mobility equation. In this model the wage equation is estimated simultaneously with the two decision equations. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the model for three education groups. Our main finding is that returns to seniority are quite high for all education groups. On the other hand, the returns to experience appear to be similar to those previously found in the literature""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Work and leisure in the U.S and Europe why so different? /,Economic theory,"""Americans average 25.1 working hours per person in working age per week, but the Germans average 18.6 hours.  The average American works 46.2 weeks per year, while the French average 40 weeks per year.  Why do western Europeans work so much less than Americans? Recent work argues that these differences result from higher European tax rates, but the vast empirical labor supply literature suggests that tax rates can explain only a small amount of the differences in hours between the U.S.  and Europe.  Another popular view is that these differences are explained by long-standing European ""culture,"" but Europeans worked more than Americans as late as the 1960s.  In this paper, we argue that European labor market regulations, advocated by unions in declining European industries who argued ""work less, work all"" explain the bulk of the difference between the U.S.  and Europe.  These policies do not seem to have increased employment, but they may have had a more society-wide influence on leisure patterns because of a social multiplier where the returns to leisure increase as more people are taking longer vacations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

"Jewish occupational selection education, restrictions, or minorities? /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper documents the major features of Jewish economic history in the first millennium to explain the distinctive occupational selection of the Jewish people into urban, skilled occupations. We show that many Jews entered urban occupations in the eighth-ninth centuries in the Muslim Empire when there were no restrictions on their economic activities, most of them were farmers, and they were a minority in all locations. Therefore, arguments based on restrictions or minority status cannot explain the occupational transition of the Jews at that time. Our thesis is that the occupational selection of the Jews was the outcome of the widespread literacy prompted by a religious and educational reform in the first century ce, which was implemented in the third to the eighth century. We present detailed information on the implementation of this religious and educational reform in Judaism based on the Talmud, archeological evidence on synagogues, the Cairo Geniza documents, and the Responsa literature. We also provide evidence of the economic returns to Jewish religious literacy""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The microeconomic evidence on capital controls no free lunch /,Economic theory,"""Macroeconomic analyses of capital controls face a number of imposing challenges and have yielded mixed results to date.  This paper takes a different approach and surveys an emerging literature that evaluates various microeconomic effects of capital controls and capital account liberalization.  Several key themes emerge.  First, capital controls tend to reduce the supply of capital, raise the cost of financing, and increase financial constraints - especially for smaller firms, firms without access to international capital markets and firms without access to preferential lending.  Second, capital controls can reduce market discipline in financial markets and the government, leading to a more inefficient allocation of capital and resources.  Third, capital controls significantly distort decision-making by firms and individuals, as they attempt to minimize the costs of the controls or even evade them outright.  Fourth, the effects of capital controls can vary across different types of firms and countries, reflecting different pre-existing economic distortions.  Finally, capital controls can be difficult and costly to enforce, even in countries with sound institutions and low levels of corruption.  This microeconomic evidence on capital controls suggests that they have pervasive effects and often generate unexpected costs.  Capital controls are no free lunch""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Lobbying competition over us trade policy,Economic theory,"""Competition between opposing lobbies is an important factor in the endogenous determination of trade policy.  This paper investigates empirically the consequences of lobbying competition between upstream and downstream producers for US trade policy.  The theoretical framework used is the well-known Grossman-Helpman model of trade policy determination suitably modified to account for the cross-sectoral use of inputs in production (the input-output matrix).  Our empirical results, using US trade data, validate the predictions of the theoretical model with lobbying competition.  Trade protection is found to be higher in industries with organized lobbies but lower when there are organized downstream users of the industry's output.  Lobbying competition is additionally interesting as a candidate explanation for an empirical puzzle in the literature concerning the apparently nearly ""welfare-maximizing"" behavior of the US government in setting trade policy.  Our estimates diminish the magnitude of the puzzle somewhat, but do not provide a full quantitative resolution of this question""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Educational attainment and child labor do subsidies work? /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""We analyze the role of education subsidies in affecting child labor where a family chooses the quantity of children, the level of educational attainment and the fraction of time an offspring spends on child labor. This is relevant because following the threat of trade sanctions and suspension of GSP privileges, many developing countries are aggressively pursuing educational policy to reduce the incidence of child labor. We find that education subsidies may increase (or reduce) the equilibrium level of education and child labor depending on the relative weight that a family attaches to quality. The latter depends on the educational attainment level. We find that subsidies that target fixed and those that target variable costs may lead to opposite effects on child labor. Given that established subsidy programs like PROGRESA have both variable and fixed components, this finding assumes special relevance. It is interesting to note that the empirical literature in this area has found that a rise in the cost of schooling decreases child labor in some countries while increasing it in others. Our findings suggest that there may be reasons for observing such apparent contradictions""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The replacement problem in frictional economies a near-equivalence result /,Economic theory,"""We examine how technological change affects wage inequality and unemployment in a calibrated model of matching frictions in the labor market. We distinguish between two polar cases studied in the literature: a ""creative destruction"" economy where new machines enter chiefly through new matches and an ""upgrading"" economy where machines in existing matches are replaced by new machines. Our main results are: (i) these two economies produce very similar quantitative outcomes, and (ii) the total amount of wage inequality generated by frictions is very small. We explain these findings in light of the fact that, in the model calibrated to the U.S. economy, both unemployment and vacancy durations are very short, i.e., the matching frictions are  quantitatively minor. Hence, the equilibrium allocations of the model are remarkably close to those of a frictionless version of our economy where .rms are indiÞerent between upgrading and creative destruction, and where every worker is paid the same market-clearing wage. These results are robust to the inclusion of machine-specific or match-specific heterogeneity into the benchmark model.""--Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond web site."
The effect of mandated state education spending on total local resources,Economic theory,"""Many states are under court-order to reduce local disparities in education spending.  While a substantial body of literature suggests that these orders and the resulting school finance equalizations have increased the level and progressivity of state education spending, there is little evidence on the broader effects of such measures on the change in total resources available not only for schools, but for other local government programs as well.  When states spend more on education, both state and local budget constraints change.  We find that while mandated school finance equalizations increase both the level and progressivity of state spending on education, states finance the required increase in education spending in part by reducing their aid to localities for other programs.  Local governments, in turn, respond to the increases in state taxation and spending by reducing both their own revenue-raising and their own spending on education and on other programs.  Thus, while state education aid does increase total spending on education, it does so at the expense of drawing resources away from spending on programs like public welfare, highways, and hospitals.  These findings provide insight into the effectiveness of using earmarked funds to achieve redistribution""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Jurisdictional advantage,Economic theory,"""Our objective in this paper is to define jurisdictional advantage, the recognition that location is critical to firms' innovative success and that every location has unique assets that are not easily replicated.  The purpose is to be normative and policy oriented.  Drawing from the well-developed literature on corporate strategy, we consider analogies to cities in their search for competitive advantage.  In contrast to the more passive term locational advantage, our use of the term jurisdiction denotes geographically-defined legal and political decision-making authority and coordination.  Thus, jurisdictions may be constructed and managed to promote a coherent activity set.  We review recent advances in our understanding of patterns of urban specialization and the composition of activities within cities, which suggest strategies that may generate economic growth as well as those strategies to avoid.  This paper then considers the role of firms and their responsibility to jurisdictions in light of the net benefits received from place-specific externalities, and concludes by considering the challenges to implementing jurisdictional advantage""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Illicit drug use among arrestees and drug prices,Economic theory,"""Previous studies, by relying on nationally representative surveys, have overlooked the important fact that use of addictive substances is not uniformly distributed; subgroups of hardcore users account for most of the drug consumption.  This study employs the Drug Use Forecasting system to analyze the demand for cocaine and heroin by arrestees, employing objective indicators of use based on urinalysis.  The data are repeated city cross-sections, and panel data methodologies are employed to control for policy endogeneity.  Cocaine and heroin prices have a negative effect on the probability of use even among this group of heavy users.  Results indicate that subjective, self-reported measures of participation are likely to be under-reported impart bias to estimates of the price elasticity.  The own-price cocaine participation elasticity is about 0.17, and the own-price heroin participation elasticity is about 0.09 for arrestees.  This contemporaneous elasticity understates the full effect, and the long-run price elasticity is about twice the magnitude.  Estimated cross-price elasticities indicate that cocaine and heroin are economic complements.  While these findings show that higher penalties, enforcement, and supply reduction activities can discourage participation by heavy users, the elasticities are smaller in magnitude relative to the estimates in the prior literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Are migrants more skilled than non-migrants? repeat, return and same-employer migrants /",Economic theory,"""I examine the determinants of inter-state migration of adults within western Germany, using the German Socio-Economic Panel from 1984-2000.  I highlight the prevalence and distinctive characteristics of migrants who do not change employers.  Same-employer migrants represent one fifth of all migrants higher education and pre-move wages than non-migrants.  Conditional on age, same-employer migrants are therefore more skilled than non-migrants.  By contrast, although other migrants have higher education than non-migrants, they do not have higher pre-move wages.  Furthermore, they have in their ranks disproportionate numbers of the non-employed, unemployed and recently laid off.  It therefore seems inappropriate to characterize them as more skilled than non-migrants.  The results for same-employer migrants indicate that skilled workers have a low-cost migration avenue that has not been considered in the previous literature.  I also analyze the relation between repeat and return migration and distinguish between short and long-distance migration.  I confirm that long-distance migrants are more skilled than short-distance migrants, as predicted by theory, and I show that return migrants are a mix of successes and failures""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trends in tariff reforms and trends in wage inequality,Finance,"""The authors provide new evidence on the impacts of trade reforms on wages and wage inequality in developing countries.  While most of the current literature on the topic achieves identification by comparing outcomes before and after one episode of trade liberalization across industries, they propose a stronger identifying strategy.  The authors explore the recent historical record of policy changes adopted by Argentina: from significant protection in the early 1970s, to the first episode of liberalization during the late 1970s, back to a slowdown of reforms during the 1980s, to the second episode of liberalization in the 1990s.  These swings in trade policy comprise broken trends in trade reforms that they can compare with observed trends in wages and wage inequality.  After setting up unusual historical data sets of trends in tariffs, trends in wages, and trends in wage inequality, the evidence supports two well-known hypotheses: trade liberalization, other things being equal, (1) has reduced wages, and (2) has increased wage inequality.

Trade in ideal varieties theory and evidence /,Economic theory,"""Models with constant-elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences are commonly employed in the international trade literature because they provide a tractable way to handle product differentiation in general equilibrium.  However this tractability comes at the cost of generating a set of counter-factual predictions regarding cross-country variation in export and import variety, output per variety, and prices.  We examine whether a generalized version of Lancaster's 'ideal variety' model can better match facts.  In this model, entry causes crowding in variety space, so that the marginal utility of new varieties falls as market size grows.  Crowding is partially offset by income effects, as richer consumers will pay more for varieties closer matched to their ideal types.  We show theoretically and confirm empirically that declining marginal utility of new varieties results in: a higher own-price elasticity of demand (and lower prices) in large countries and a lower own-price elasticity of demand (and higher prices) in rich countries.  Model predictions about cross-country differences in the number and size of establishments are also empirically confirmed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Law and finance circa 1900,Economic theory,"""How persistent are the effects of legal institutions adopted or inherited in the distant past? A substantial literature argues that legal origins have persistent effects that explain clear differences in investor protections and financial development around the world today (La Porta et al, 1998, 1999 and passim).  This paper examines the persistence of the effects of legal origins by examining new estimates of different indicators of financial development in more than 20 countries in 1900 and 1913.  The evidence presented does not yield robust results that can sustain the hypothesis of persistence effects of legal origin, but it is not powerful enough to reject it either.  Then the paper examines if there were systematic differences in the extent of investor protections across countries, since that is the main channel through which legal origin affects financial development, and shows that all the evidence supports the idea of relative convergence in corporate governance practices across legal families circa 1900.  The paper concludes that, if the evidence presented is representative, the variation observed in financial development around the world today is likely a product of events of the twentieth century rather than a consequence of long-term (and persistent) differences occasioned by legal traditions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Mitigation, trade, and foreign investment in Mexico",Finance,"""Part of the rationale for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was that it would increase trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, creating jobs and reducing migration to the United States.  Since poor data on illegal flows to the United States make direct measurement difficult, Aroca and Maloney instead evaluate the mechanism behind these predictions using data on migration within Mexico where the census data permit careful analysis.  They offer the first specifications for migration within Mexico, incorporating measures of cost of living, amenities, and networks.  Contrary to much of the literature, labor market variables enter very significantly and as predicted once the authors control for possible credit constraint effects.  Greater exposure to FDI and trade deters out-migration with the effects working partly through the labor market.  Finally, the authors generate some tentative inferences about the impact on increased FDI on Mexico-U.S.  migration.  On average, a doubling of FDI inflows leads to a 1.5-2 percent fall in migration.

Do mood swings drive business cycles and is it rational?,Economic theory,"""This paper provides new evidence in support of the idea that bouts of optimism and pessimism drive much of US business cycles.  In particular, we begin by using sign-restriction based identification schemes to isolate innovations in optimism or pessimism and we document the extent to which such episodes explain macroeconomic fluctuations.  We then examine the link between these identified mood shocks and subsequent developments in fundamentals using alternative identification schemes (i.e., variants of the maximum forecast error variance approach).  We find that there is a very close link between the two, suggesting that agents' feelings of optimism and pessimism are at least partially rational as total factor productivity (TFP) is observed to rise 8-10 quarters after an initial bout of optimism.  While this later finding is consistent with some previous findings in the news shock literature, we cannot rule out that such episodes reflect self-fulfilling beliefs.  Overall, we argue that mood swings account for over 50% of business cycle fluctuations in hours and output""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Smooth politicians and paternalistic voters a theory of large elections /,Economic theory,"""We propose a new game theoretic approach to modeling large elections that overcomes the ""paradox of voting"" in a costly voting framework, without reliance on the assumption of ad hoc preferences for voting.  The key innovation that we propose is the adoption of a ""smooth"" policy rule under which the degree to which parties favor their own interests is increasing in their margin of victory.  In other words, mandates matter.  We argue that this approach is an improvement over the existing literature as it is consistent with the empirical evidence.  Incorporating this policy rule into a costly voting model with paternalistic voters yields a parsimonious model with attractive properties.  Specifically, the model predicts that when the size of the electorate grows without bound, limiting turnout is strictly positive both in terms of numbers and proportions.  Further, the model preserves the typical comparative statics predictions that have been identified in the extant costly voting models such as the underdog effect and the competition effect.  Finally, under the case of selfish agents, we are able to extend Palfrey and Rosenthal's (1985) zero turnout result to a general class of smooth policy rules.  Thus, this new approach reconciles the predictions of standard costly voting, both in terms of positive turnout and comparative statics predictions with the assumption of a large electorate environment""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Aggregate hours worked in OECD countries new measurement and implications for business cycles /,Economic theory,"""We build a new quarterly dataset of aggregate hours worked consistent with standard NIPA constructs for 14 OECD countries over the last fifty years.  We find that cyclical features of labor markets across countries differ markedly from the accepted empirical facts reported in the literature based on either just U.S.  hours data, or based on cross-country employment data.  We document that total hours worked in many OECD countries are about as volatile as output, that a relatively large fraction of labor market adjustment takes place along the intensive margin outside the United States, and that the volatility of total hours relative to output volatility has increased over time in almost all countries.  We use these data to re-assess productivity and labor wedges during the Great Recession and during prior recessions.  We find that the Great Recession in many OECD countries is a significant puzzle in that labor wedges are quite small, while those in the U.S.  Great Recession - and those in previous European recessions - are much larger.  These new data indicate that understanding cyclical labor fluctuations in OECD countries requires understanding why hours fluctuate so much more than previously considered, how and why labor markets changed so much in the last few years, why cyclical adjustment of hours per worker in countries with large firing costs is not even larger than observed, and why the Great Recession differs so much across countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"The best of times, the worst of times understanding pro-cyclical mortality /",Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  A growing literature documents cyclical movements in mortality and health.  We examine this pattern more closely and attempt to identify the mechanisms behind it.  Specifically, we distinguish between mechanisms that rely on fluctuations in own employment or time use and those involving factors that are external to the individual.  Our investigation suggests that changes in individuals' own behavior contribute very little to pro-cyclical mortality.  Looking across broad age and gender groups, we find that own-group employment rates are not systematically related to own-group mortality.  In addition, we find that most of the additional deaths that occur during times of economic growth are among the elderly, particularly elderly women, who have limited labor force attachment.  Focusing on mortality among the elderly, we show that cyclicality is especially strong for deaths occurring in nursing homes, and is stronger in states where a higher fraction of the elderly reside in nursing homes.  We also demonstrate that staffing in skilled nursing facilities moves counter-cyclically.  Taken together, these findings suggest that cyclical fluctuations in the mortality rate may be largely driven by fluctuations in the quality of health care""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The other ex-ante moral hazard in health,Economic theory,"""It is well known that public or pooled insurance coverage can induce a form of ex-ante moral hazard: people make inefficiently low investments in self-protective activities.  This paper points out another ex-ante moral hazard that arises through an induced innovation externality.  This alternative mechanism, by contrast, causes people to devote an inefficiently high level of self-protection.  As an empirical example of this externality, we analyze the innovation induced by the obesity epidemic.  Obesity is associated with an increase in the incidence of many diseases.  The induced innovation hypothesis is that an increase in the incidence of a disease will increase technological innovation specific to that disease.  The empirical economics literature has produced substantial evidence in favor of the induced innovation hypothesis.We first estimate the associations between obesity and disease incidence.  We then show that if these associations are causal and the pharmaceutical reward system is optimal the magnitude of the induced innovation externality of obesity roughly coincides with the Medicare-induced health insurance externality of obesity.  The current Medicare subsidy for obesity therefore appears to be approximately optimal.  We also show that the pattern of diseases for obese and normal weight individuals are similar enough that the induced innovation externality of obesity on normal weight individuals is positive as well""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"On inferring demand for health care in the presence of anchoring, acquiescence, and selection biases",Economic theory,"""In the contingent valuation literature, both anchoring and acquiescence biases pose problems when using an iterative bidding game to infer willingness to pay.  Anchoring bias occurs when the willingness to pay estimate is sensitive to the initially presented starting value.  Acquiescence bias occurs when survey respondents exhibit a tendency to answer 'yes' to questions, regardless of their true preferences.  More generally, whenever a survey format is used and not all of those contacted participate, selection bias raises concerns about the representativeness of the sample.  In this paper, we estimate students' willingness to pay for student health care at Stanford University while accounting for all of these biases.  As there is no cost sharing for students, we assess willingness to pay by having a random sample of students play an online iterative bidding game.  Our main results are that (1) demand for student health care is elastic by conventional standards; (2) ignoring anchoring bias would lead to a substantially biased measure of the demand elasticity; (3) there is evidence for acquiescence bias in student answers to the opening question of the iterative bidding game and failure to address this leads to the biased conclusion that demand is inelastic; and (4) standard selection correction methods indicate no bias from selective non-response and newer bounding methods support this conclusion of elastic demand""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Hepatitis B does not explain male-biased sex ratios in China,Economic theory,"""Earlier work (Oster, 2005) has argued, based on existing medical literature and analysis of cross country data and vaccination programs, that parents who are carriers of hepatitis B have a higher offspring sex ratio (more boys) than non-carrier parents.  Further, since a number of Asian countries, China in particular, have high hepatitis B carrier rates, Oster (2005) suggested that hepatitis B could explain a large share { approximately 50% { of Asia's \missing women"".  Subsequent work has questioned this conclusion.  Most notably, Lin and Luoh (2008) use data from a large cohort of births in Taiwan and find only a very tiny effect of maternal hepatitis carrier status on offspring sex ratio.  Although this work is quite conclusive for the case of mothers, it leaves open the possibility that paternal carrier status is driving higher sex offspring sex ratios.  To test this, we collected data on the offspring gender for a cohort of 67,000 people in China who are being observed in a prospective cohort study of liver cancer; approximately 15% of these individuals are hepatitis B carriers.  In this sample, we find no effect of either maternal or paternal hepatitis B carrier status on offspring sex.  Carrier parents are no more likely to have male children than non-carrier parents.  This finding leads us to conclude that hepatitis B cannot explain skewed sex ratios in China""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
First in the class? age and the education production function /,Economic theory,"""Older children outperform younger children in a school-entry cohort well into their school careers.  The existing literature has provided little insight into the causes of this phenomenon, leaving open the possibility that school-entry age is zero-sum game, where relatively young students lose what relatively old students gain.  In this paper, we estimate the effects of relative age using data from an experiment where children of the same biological age were randomly assigned to different classrooms at the start of school.  We find no evidence that relative age impacts achievement in the population at large.  However, disadvantaged children assigned to a classroom where they are among the youngest students are less likely to take a college-entrance exam than others of the same biological age.  Controlling for relative age also reveals no long-term effect of biological age at school entry in the aggregate, but striking differences by socioeconomic status: Disadvantaged children who are older at the start of kindergarten are less likely to take the SAT or ACT, while the opposite may be true for children from more advantaged families.  These findings suggest that, far from being zero-sum, school-entry age has far-reaching consequences for the level of achievement and achievement gaps between the rich and poor""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Complements versus substitutes and trends in fertility choice in dynastic models,Economic theory,"""The Barro-Becker model is a simple intuitive model of fertility choice.  In its original formulation, however, it has not been very successful at reproducing the changes in fertility choice in response to decreased mortality and increased income growth that demographers have emphasized in explaining the demographic transition.  In this paper we show that this is due to an implicit assumption that number and utility of children are complements, which is a byproduct of the high intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) typically assumed in the fertility literature.  We show that, not only is this assumption not necessary, but both the qualitative and quantitative properties of the model in terms of fertility choice change dramatically when substitutability and high curvature are assumed.  To do so, we first derive analytical comparative statics and perform quantitative experiments.  We find that if IES is less than one, model predictions of changes in fertility amount to about two-thirds of those observed in U.S.  data since 1800.  There are two major sources to these predicted changes, the increase in the growth rate of productivity which accounts for about 90 percent of the predicted fall in fertility before 1880, and changes in mortality which account for 90 percent of the predicted change from 1880 to 1950""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Neighborhood violence and urban youth,Economic theory,"""Three quarters of American children have been exposed to neighborhood violence in their lifetimes.  Most of the existing research has concluded that exposure to violence leads to restricted emotional development, aggressive behavior and poor school outcomes.  However, this literature fails to account for the fact that children exposed to neighborhood violence are highly disadvantaged in other ways: they are more likely to be black, poor and have poorly educated parents.  As such, it is not clear whether exposure to violence or the underlying measures of disadvantage are responsible for the poor child outcomes observed.  Using individual survey data on urban youth and their families from Los Angeles, we find that the most violent neighborhoods are also characterized by the highest degree of disadvantage: greatest poverty, highest unemployment, least education.  And while living in a violent neighborhood increases the probability of exposure to violence, within violent neighborhoods those personally exposed to street violence are significantly more disadvantaged and are more likely to associate with violent peers than their unexposed neighbors.  Once we control for observed and unobserved family disadvantage, the impact of violence declines for some child outcomes, suggesting that underlying disadvantage explains some of the negative outcomes observed, but not all - it is still the case that associating with violent peers is negatively correlated with cognitive test scores.  In addition, when we control for underlying differences across families, the relationship between violence and internalizing behavioral problems appears stronger""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Is the 2007 U.S. sub-prime financial crisis so different? an international historical comparison /,Economic theory,"""Is the 2007-2008 U.S.  sub-prime mortgage financial crisis truly a new and different phenomena? Our examination of the longer historical record finds stunning qualitative and quantitative parallels to 18 earlier post-war banking crises in industrialized countries.  Specifically, the run-up in U.S.  equity and housing prices (which, for countries experiencing large capital inflows, stands out as the best leading indicator in the financial crisis literature) closely tracks the average of the earlier crises.  Another important parallel is the inverted v-shape curve for output growth the U.S.  experienced as its economy slowed in the eve of the crisis.  Among other indicators, the run-up in U.S.  public debt and is actually somewhat below the average of other episodes, and its pre-crisis inflation level is also lower.  On the other hand, the United States current account deficit trajectory is worse than average.  A critical question is whether the U.S.  crisis will prove similar to the most severe industrialized-country crises, in which case growth may fall significantly below trend for an extended period.  Or will it prove like one of the milder episodes, where the recovery is relatively fast? Much will depend on how large the shock to the financial system proves to be and, to a lesser extent, on the efficacy of the subsequent policy response""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Can exchange rates forecast commodity prices?,Economic theory,"""This paper demonstrates that ""commodity currency"" exchange rates have remarkably robust power in predicting future global commodity prices, both in-sample and out-of-sample.  A critical element of our in-sample approach is to allow for structural breaks, endemic to empirical exchange rate models, by implementing the approach of Rossi (2005b).  Aside from its practical implications, our forecasting results provide perhaps the most convincing evidence to date that the exchange rate depends on the present value of identifiable exogenous fundamentals.  We also find that the reverse relationship holds; that is, that commodity prices Granger-cause exchange rates.  However, consistent with the vast post-Meese-Rogoff (1983a,b) literature on forecasting exchange rates, we find that the reverse forecasting regression does not survive out-of-sample testing.  We argue, however, that it is quite plausible that exchange rates will be better predictors of exogenous commodity prices than vice-versa, because the exchange rate is fundamentally forward looking.  Therefore, following Campbell and Shiller (1987) and Engel and West (2005), the exchange rate is likely to embody important information about future commodity price movements well beyond what econometricians can capture with simple time series models.  In contrast, prices for most commodities are extremely sensitive to small shocks to current demand and supply, and are therefore likely to be less forward looking""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Portraits of the artist personal visual art in the twentieth century /,Economic theory,"""Scholars of literature have devoted considerable attention to what they have called confessional or personal poetry, in which Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and a series of other poets, from the 1950s on, made their art out of the experiences of their own lives.  Yet art scholars have not analyzed a parallel practice in the visual arts, in which painters and sculptors have used motifs drawn largely or exclusively from their own lives.  This practice was begun by Vincent van Gogh in the late nineteenth century, and it subsequently influenced a diverse group of major artists, including such conceptual artists as Edvard Munch, Frida Kahlo, Joseph Beuys, Bruce Nauman, Cindy Sherman, and Tracey Emin, and the experimental artists Francis Bacon and Louise Bourgeois.  Although van Gogh did not think of his practice of painting himself and the people and things he cared most about as novel, others soon recognized it as an innovation that would help them to achieve their artistic goals, and personal art became a distinctive feature of the advanced art of the twentieth century.  That personal art first appeared in the late nineteenth century, and became more common in the twentieth, reflects the increased autonomy of painters that was a consequence of the development of a competitive market for advanced art after the Impressionists' successful challenge to the monopoly of the official Salon""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Impact of first occupation on health at older ages,Economic theory,"""Occupation is discussed as a social determinant of health.  Occupation has received little attention in this light in the economics literature.  We examine occupation in a life-course framework and use measures of first-occupation, initial health, and mother's education.  We contend that first occupation is a choice made relatively early in life that affects health outcomes at later ages.  We examine first-occupation for two reasons: 1) there is growing evidence that early determinants affect later health and occupation has received little attention in this regard and 2) first occupation is predetermined in analysis of later health, which helps to address the issue of potential simultaneity.  Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) we estimate the impact of initial occupation on two measures of health later in life: respondent-reported fair/poor health and ever suffering a heart attack.  The PSID offers the opportunity to examine a lifecycle perspective as we can examine the impact of early occupation on later health while controlling for several predetermined conditions such as mother's education and health in youth.  Estimates suggest that first-occupation has a durable impact on later health, ceteris paribus, but that the impact varies by health measure and the set of control variables in regression specifications.  Early choice of occupation could be a critical factor in successful aging and this information may pave the way to developing more effective workplace and public policies to improve health in older ages""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Vocational schooling, labor market outcomes, and college entry",Finance,"""This paper examines the differentiated outcomes of vocational and general secondary academic education, particularly in terms of employment opportunities, labor market earnings, and access to tertiary education in Indonesia.  With data from a panel of two waves of the Indonesia Family Life Survey in 1997 and 2000, the paper tracks a cohort of high school students in 1997 to examine their schooling and employment status in 2000.  The findings demonstrate that: (1) attendance at vocational secondary schools results in neither market advantage nor disadvantage in terms of employment opportunities and/or earnings premium; (2) attendance at vocational schools leads to significantly lower academic achievement as measured by national test scores; and (3) There is no stigma attached to attendance at vocational schools that results in a disadvantage in access to tertiary education; rather, it is the lower academic achievement associated with attendance at vocational school that lowers the likelihood of entering college.  The empirical approach of this paper addresses two limitations of the existing literature in this area.  First, it takes into account the observation censoring issue due to college entry when evaluating labor market outcomes of secondary school graduates.  Second, using an instrumental variable approach, the paper also treats endogeneity of household choice of vocational versus academic track of secondary education, teasing out the net effect of secondary school choice on labor market and schooling outcomes.

What drives firm productivity growth ?,Finance,"""This paper presents new evidence on the causal links between changes in the business environment and firm productivity growth.  It contributes to the literature in three important aspects.  First, it constructs a unique database merging information from two large firm-level databases.  The samples of both databases are merged on four criteria-country, sub-national location, firm size, and year-producing a panel of 22,004 firms in eight economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia,, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine.  Second, the paper addresses shortcomings of earlier studies, namely reverse causation, multicollinearity, and unreliable productivity estimates.  Firm productivity growth is estimated drawing on corporate financial data from manufacturing firms included in the AMADEUS database.  Changes in the business environment are estimated from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys conducted in 2002 and 2005.  Multicollinearity problems in the full model regression are mitigated by constructing a set of six aggregate indicators of the business environment (using principal component analysis).  The paper finds that, over the period 2001 to 2004, an increase of one standard deviation in infrastructure quality, financial development, governance, labor market flexibility, labor quality, and market competition raises the total factor productivity of the average firm by 9.8, 7.8, 3.2, 3.4, 5.8, and 3 percent, respectively.  Lastly, the paper decomposes firm productivity growth and ranks the relative impact of changes in these six aspects of the business environment by country, by firm size, and by industry.

"Race, immigration, and the U.S. labor market contrasting the outcomes of foreign born and native blacks /",Finance,"""It is generally expected that immigrants do not fare as well as the native-born in the U.S.  labor market.  The literature also documents that Blacks experience lower labor market outcomes than Whites.  This paper innovates by studying the interaction between race and immigration.  The study compares the labor market outcomes of four racial groups in the United States (Whites, Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics) interacted with their foreign born status, using the Integrated Public Use Micro Data Series data for the 2000 Census.  Among women and for labor market outcomes such as labor force participation, employment, and personal income, the foreign born are doing worse than the native born from the same racial background, with the exception of Blacks.  Among men, for labor force participation and employment, foreign-born Blacks are doing better than native Blacks.  The paper tests different possible explanations for this ""reversal"" of the advantage of natives over immigrants among Blacks.  It considers citizenship, ability in English, age at and time since arrival in the United States, as well as neighborhood effects, but concludes that none of these channels explains or modifies the observed reversal.

Potential applications of conditional cash transfers for prevention of sexually transmitted infections and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa,Finance,"""A growing number of developing countries have introduced conditional cash transfer programs that provide money to poor families with certain contingencies attached - such as requiring school attendance or regular immunization and health check-ups.  As the popularity of conditional cash transfer programs has grown, experimentation with potential applications in other areas of health, such as sexual and reproductive health, and HIV prevention, in particular, has also increased.  Evaluations of conditional cash transfer programs have focused almost exclusively on uptake of health and educational services, which make relatively low demands of participants compared with more complex interventions, which require the cessation of risky behaviors, such as smoking, obesity, and substance abuse.  The literature on contingency management - based on the principle that behavioral change occurs when appropriate behaviors are reinforced and rewarded - provides a richer picture of the complexity of the use of conditionality to encourage healthy behavioral change.  This paper examines developing countries' experiences with conditional cash transfer programs and the results of trials in clinical settings on the efficacy of contingency management, and addresses their relevance for designing conditional cash transfer programs to address risky sexual behavior and promote the prevention of sexually transmitted infections and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Testing theories of scarcity pricing in the airline industry,Economic theory,"""This paper investigates why passengers pay substantially different fares for travel on the same airline between the same two airports.  We investigate questions that are fundamentally different from those in the existing literature on airline price dispersion.  We use a unique new dataset to test between two broad classes of theories regarding airline pricing.  The first group of theories, as advanced by Dana (1999b) and Gale and Holmes (1993), postulates that airlines practice scarcity based pricing and predicts that variation in ticket prices is driven by differences between high demand and low demand periods.  The second group of theories is that airlines practice price discrimination by using ticketing restrictions to segment customers by willingness to pay.  We use a unique dataset, a census of ticket transactions from one of the major computer reservation systems, to study the relationships between fares, ticket characteristics, and flight load factors.  The central advantage of our dataset is that it contains variables not previously available that permit a test of these theories.  We find only mixed support for the scarcity pricing theories.  Flights during high demand periods have slightly higher fares but exhibit no more fare dispersion than flights where demand is low.  Moreover, the fraction of discounted advance purchase seats is only slightly higher on off-peak flights.  However, ticket characteristics that are associated with second-degree price discrimination drive much of the variation in ticket pricing""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The Japanese bubble a 'heterogeneous' approach /,Economic theory,"""Employing the neutral Kindleberger definition of a bubble as ""an upward price movement over an extended range that then implodes"", this paper explores the causes of the ""Japanese Bubble"" of 1985 to 1990 without precluding the possibility that the bubble was due to perceptions of fundamentals.  Survey evidence indicates that at the peak of the bubble in the second half of 1989, the majority of Japanese institutional investors thought that the Nikkei was not overvalued relative to fundamentals.  Such a belief was not entirely unfounded.  Long-term real interest rates fell sharply between 1985 and 1986, and the view that there was a significant increase in the permanent component of the growth rate was defensible though certainly not undeniable.  Invoking the literature on asset prices with heterogeneous beliefs and limitations on short sales, the paper argues that in a period characterized by the arrival of news that is difficult to digest and subject to multiple interpretations, it is the more optimistic assessments of fundamentals that are likely to be reflected in the market equilibrium.  At the same time, high prices resulting from the heterogeneity phenomenon are fragile and prone to collapse.  From this vantage point it is perhaps not surprising that the Japanese Bubble, as well as the subsequent implosion, appeared when they did.  Survey evidence on investor beliefs during the bubble period, as well as the covariation of price and volume, lend some support to the heterogeneity approach""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Intended and unintended consequences of prison reform,Economic theory,"""Since the 1970s, U.S.  federal courts have issued court orders condemning state prison crowding.  However, the impact of these court orders on prison spending and prison conditions is theoretically ambiguous because it is unclear if these court orders are enforceable.  We examine states' responses to court interventions and show that these interventions generate higher per inmate incarceration costs, lower inmate mortality rates, and a reduction in prisoners per capita.  If states seek to minimize the cost of crime through deterrence, an increase in prison costs should lead states to shift resources from corrections to other means of deterring crime such as welfare and education spending.However, we find that court interventions, that are associated with higher corrections expenditures, lead to lower welfare expenditures.  This suggests that the burden of increased correctional spending is borne by the poor.  Furthermore, states do not increase welfare spending after their release from court order; making the reduction in welfare spending permanent.  Thus, our results suggest that states do not respond to prison reform in the manner prescribed by the deterrence model.  States' responses to prison reform are most consistent with the predictions in the empirical public finance literature that indicate stickiness in expenditure categories and that increases in spending in programs that affect the poor generate declines in expenditures in other program that are also targeted to the poor""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The tax treatment of homeowners and landlords and the progressivity of income taxation,Economic theory,"""This paper analyzes the connection between the asymmetric tax treatment of homeowners and landlords and the progressivity of income taxation using a quantitative overlapping generations general equilibrium model with housing and rental markets.  Our model emphasizes the determinants of tenure choice (own vs.  rent) and the household decision to supply housing services to the rental market.  This formulation breaks the link between the rental price and the equilibrium interest rate and, hence, the aggregate supply of rental property responds differently to the direction of rental price changes, marginal tax rate changes, and maintenance cost changes.  We show that the model replicates the key factors and the distributional patterns of ownership, house size, and landlords.  The degree of progressivity in the income tax code has important implications for housing tenure and housing consumption.  We find a movement toward a less progressive income tax code can generate sizeable increases in homeownership and welfare that result from the equilibrium effects and a portfolio reallocation mechanism absent in economies with a single asset (i.e.  Conesa and Krueger (2006)).  An examination of the removal of existing asymmetries in the tax code are found to have effects on housing that differ from those reported in the literature.  We show that housing policy can increase the ownership rate of a particular segment of the population, but generate nontrivial distributional costs.  The welfare increases are no larger than those found when the progressivity of the tax code is reduced""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
Brain drain or brain gain? micro evidence from an African success story,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Does emigration really drain human capital accumulation in origin countries? This paper explores a unique household survey purposely designed and conducted to answer this specific question for the case of Cape Verde - the African country with the largest fraction of tertiary educated population living abroad, despite also having a fast-growing stock of human capital. Unlike previous literature, our tailored survey allows us to adjust existing inflated ""brain drain"" numbers for educational upgrading of emigrants after migration. We do so by combining our survey data on current, return and non-migrants with information from censuses of the destination countries. Our micro data also enables us to propose a novel, explicit test of ""brain gain"" arguments according to which the possibility of own future emigration positively impacts educational attainment in the origin country. Crucially, the innovative empirical strategy we propose hinges on the ideal characteristics of our survey, namely on full histories of migrants and on a new set of exclusion restrictions to control for unobserved heterogeneity of emigrants. Our results point to a very substantial impact of the ""brain gain"" channel on the educational attainment of those left behind. Alternative channels (namely remittances, family disruption, and general equilibrium effects at the local level) are also considered, but these do not seem to play an important role. Overall, we find that there may be substantial human capital gains from allowing free migration and encouraging return migration""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Simple versus optimal rules as guides to policy,Economic theory,"""This paper contributes to the policy evaluation literature by developing new strategies to study alternative policy rules.  We compare optimal rules to simple rules within canonical monetary policy models.  In our context, an optimal rule represents the solution to an intertemporal optimization problem in which a loss function for the policymaker and an explicit model of the macroeconomy are specified.  We define a simple rule to be a summary of the intuition policymakers and economists have about how a central bank should react to aggregate disturbances.  The policy rules are evaluated under minimax and minimax regret criteria.  These criteria force the policymaker to guard against a worst-case scenario, but in different ways.  Minimax makes the worst possible model the benchmark for the policymaker, while minimax regret confronts the policymaker with uncertainty about the true model.  Our results indicate that the case for a model-specific optimal rule can break down when uncertainty exists about which of several models is true.  Further, we show that the assumption that the policymaker's loss function is known can obscure policy trade-offs that exist in the short, medium, and long run.  Thus, policy evaluation is more difficult once it is recognized that model and preference uncertainty can interact""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Model comparison using the Hansen-Jagannathan distance,Economic theory,"""Although it is of interest to empirical researchers to test whether or not a particular asset-pricing model is true, a more useful task is to determine how wrong a model is and to compare the performance of competing asset-pricing models.  In this paper, we propose a new methodology to test whether two competing linear asset-pricing models have the same Hansen-Jagannathan distance.  We show that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic depends on whether the competing models are correctly specified or misspecified and are nested or nonnested.  In addition, given the increasing interest in misspecified models, we propose a simple methodology for computing the standard errors of the estimated stochastic discount factor parameters that are robust to model misspecification.  Using the same data as in Hodrick and Zhang (2001), we show that the commonly used returns and factors are, for the most part, too noisy to conclude that one model is superior to the other models in terms of Hansen-Jagannathan distance.  In addition, we show that many of the macroeconomic factors commonly used in the literature are no longer priced once potential model misspecification is taken into account""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Urban crime and labor mobility,Economic theory,"""We present a model of crime where two municipalities exist within a metro area (MSA).  Consistent with the literature, local law enforcement has a crime reduction effect and a crime diversion effect.  The former confers a spillover benefit to the other municipality, while the latter a spillover cost.  If the net spillovers are positive (negative), then the respective Nash enforcement levels are too low (high) from the perspective of the MSA.  When we allow for Tiebout type mobility, labor will move to the location offering lower disutility crime (including the tax burden).  To attract labor both jurisdictions would like to raise the relative crime that exists in the competing region.  Interestingly, this could raise or reduce enforcement compared to the immobility case.  If it was too high (low) under immobility, it will be raised (reduced) further under mobility.  In the symmetric case, neither can gain any labor, but the competition for it pushes the jurisdictions further away from the efficient (cooperative) outcome.  Thus, mobility must be welfare reducing.  We also consider asymmetry in the context of differences in efficiency of enforcement.  The low cost municipality has the lower crime damage (inclusive of the tax burden) and attracts labor.  Mobility is necessarily welfare reducing for the high cost municipality and for the MSA, but it has an ambiguous effect on the low cost municipality""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
"Cigarette taxes and youth smoking new evidence from national, state, & local youth risk behavior surveys /",Economic theory,"""Several studies have examined the effects of state cigarette tax increases on youth substance use over the 1990s, with most -- but not all -- finding that higher taxes reduce youth consumption of tobacco.  We advance the literature by using data from the 1991-2005 waves of the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS), providing information on over 100,000 high school age youths.  We also are the first to make use of hundreds of independently fielded state and local versions of the YRBS, reflecting data from over 750,000 youths.  Importantly, these data are to our knowledge the only sources of relevant information on youth smoking that were explicitly designed to be representative of the sampled state or locality.  We estimate two-way fixed effects models of the effect of state cigarette taxes on youth smoking, controlling for survey demographics and area and year fixed effects.  Our most consistent finding is that -- contrary to some recent research -- the large state tobacco tax increases of the past 15 years were associated with significant reductions in smoking participation and frequent smoking by youths.  Our price elasticity estimates for smoking participation by high school youths are generally smaller than previous cross-sectional approaches but are similar to recent quasi-experimental estimates""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The welfare cost of asymmetric information evidence from the u.k. annuity market /,Economic theory,"""Much of the extensive empirical literature on insurance markets has focused on whether adverse selection can be detected.  Once detected, however, there has been little attempt to quantify its importance.  We start by showing theoretically that the efficiency cost of adverse selection cannot be inferred from reduced form evidence of how ""adversely selected"" an insurance market appears to be.  Instead, an explicit model of insurance contract choice is required.  We develop and estimate such a model in the context of the U.K.  annuity market.  The model allows for private information about risk type (mortality) as well as heterogeneity in preferences over different contract options.  We focus on the choice of length of guarantee among individuals who are required to buy annuities.  The results suggest that asymmetric information along the guarantee margin reduces welfare relative to a first-best, symmetric information benchmark by about Đ127 million per year, or about 2 percent of annual premiums.  We also find that government mandates, the canonical solution to adverse selection problems, do not necessarily improve on the asymmetric information equilibrium.  Depending on the contract mandated, mandates could reduce welfare by as much as Đ107 million annually, or increase it by as much as Đ127 million.  Since determining which mandates would be welfare improving is empirically difficult, our findings suggest that achieving welfare gains through mandatory social insurance may be harder in practice than simple theory may suggest""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Left behind by design proficiency counts and test-based accountability /,Economic theory,"""Many test-based accountability systems, including the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), place great weight on the numbers of students who score at or above specified proficiency levels in various subjects.  Accountability systems based on these metrics often provide incentives for teachers and principals to target children near current proficiency levels for extra attention, but these same systems provide weak incentives to devote extra attention to students who are clearly proficient already or who have little chance of becoming proficient in the near term.  We show based on fifth grade test scores from the Chicago Public Schools that both the introduction of NCLB in 2002 and the introduction of similar district level reforms in 1996 generated noteworthy increases in reading and math scores among students in the middle of the achievement distribution.  Nonetheless, the least academically advantaged students in Chicago did not score higher in math or reading following the introduction of accountability, and we find only mixed evidence of score gains among the most advantaged students.  A large existing literature argues that accountability systems built around standardized tests greatly affect the amount of time that teachers devote to different topics.  Our results for fifth graders in Chicago, as well as related results for sixth graders after the 1996 reform, suggest that the choice of the proficiency standard in such accountability systems determines the amount of time that teachers devote to students of different ability levels""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Minimum wages and employment,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""We review the burgeoning literature on the employment effects of minimum wages -- in the United States and other countries -- that was spurred by the new minimum wage research beginning in the early 1990s. Our review indicates that there is a wide range of existing estimates and, accordingly, a lack of consensus about the overall effects on low-wage employment of an increase in the minimum wage. However, the oft-stated assertion that recent research fails to support the traditional view that the minimum wage reduces the employment of low-wage workers is clearly incorrect. A sizable majority of the studies surveyed in this monograph give a relatively consistent (although not always statistically significant) indication of negative employment effects of minimum wages. In addition, among the papers we view as providing the most credible evidence, almost all point to negative employment effects, both for the United States as well as for many other countries. Two other important conclusions emerge from our review. First, we see very few -- if any -- studies that provide convincing evidence of positive employment effects of minimum wages, especially from those studies that focus on the broader groups (rather than a narrow industry) for which the competitive model predicts disemployment effects. Second, the studies that focus on the least-skilled groups provide relatively overwhelming evidence of stronger disemployment effects for these groups""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Do college-bound high school students need an extra year? evidence from Ontario's 'double cohort',"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) interpretation of the IV estimates of the returns to schooling is becoming increasingly popular. Typically, researchers reporting LATE estimates do not provide systematic evidence that there is substantial heterogeneity across different ability levels in returns, and without such evidence, the LATE interpretation is short of being compelling. The recent abolition of Grade 13 in Ontario's secondary school system provides a unique opportunity to measure the benefits of an extra year of high school for high-ability students (those bound for college), rather than dropouts. I present a simple factor model which allows the value-added of Grade 13 (in terms of achievement) to be estimated, generalizing the standard difference-in-differences estimator to correct for heterogeneity in ability measurement across college subjects. The main finding is that the estimated return to an extra year of high school in terms of human capital is small for these high-ability students: students coming out of Grade 13 have a 2.2 point advantage (on a 100 point scale) over students from Grade 12, the estimated return to Grade 13 being around 2 percent. This evidence indicates that there is substantial heterogeneity in the return to an additional year of high school in the direction assumed in the prior literature""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Interactions between workers and the technology of production evidence from professional baseball /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper examines how the effort choices of workers within the same firm interact with each other. In contrast to the existing literature, we show that workers can affect the productivity of their co-workers based on income maximization considerations, rather than relying on behavioral considerations such as peer pressure, social norms, and shame. Theoretically, we show that a worker's effort has a positive effect on the effort of co-workers if they are complements in production, and a negative effect if they are substitutes. The theory is tested using panel data on the performance of baseball players from 1970 to 2003. The empirical analysis shows that a player's batting average significantly increases with the batting performance of his peers, but decreases with the quality of the team's pitching. Furthermore, a pitcher's performance increases with the pitching quality of his teammates, but is unaffected by the batting output of the team. These results are inconsistent with behavioral explanations which predict that shirking by any kind of worker will increase shirking by all fellow workers. The results are consistent with the idea that the effort choices of workers interact in ways that are dependent on the technology of production. These findings are robust to controlling for individual fixed-effects, and to using changes in the composition of one's co-workers in order to produce exogenous variation in the performance of one's peers""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Unemployment insurance in Europe unemployment duration and subsequent employment stability /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The empirical literature on unemployment insurance has focused on its direct effect on unemployment duration, while the potential indirect effect on employment stability through a more efficient matching process, as the unemployed can search for a longer period, has attracted much less attention. In the European context this is surprising as reform proposals of the unemployment insurance system aiming at reducing high European unemployment rates should consider both effects. This paper provides evidence on the effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment and employment duration in Europe, using individual data from the European Community Household Panel for eight countries. Country specific estimates based on a multivariate discrete proportional hazard model, controlling for observed and unobserved individual heterogeneity, suggest that even if receiving benefits has a direct negative effect increasing the duration of unemployment spells, there is also a positive indirect effect of benefits on subsequent employment duration. This indirect effect is pronounced in countries with relatively generous benefit systems, and for recipients who have remained unemployed for at least six months. In terms of the magnitude of the effect, recipients remain employed on average two to four months longer than non-recipients. This represents a ten to twenty per cent increase relative to the average employment duration, compensating for the additional time spent in unemployment. These findings are in line with theories suggesting a matching effect of unemployment insurance""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
1.5 generation internal migration in the US dispersion from states of immigration? /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The issue of immigrant spatial concentration and the possibilities for immigrant dispersion through migration features in at least three interrelated debates about immigration. First, the ethnic enclave literature centers on the question of whether spatial concentration improves or harms the economic well-being of immigrants. Second, spatial assimilation theory links immigrant relocation away from residential enclaves to socioeconomic gains. Although framed at an intra-urban scale, we suggest that similar assimilation logics infuse thinking and expectations about immigrant settlement and spatial mobility at other scales. And third, immigrant clustering links to anxieties about the threats posed by non-European origin newcomers to the traditional cultural fabric of the nation. In the current wave of immigration, research on questions of settlement geography and spatial mobility has so far been restricted to the first generation. But as the current wave of immigration matures there is a growing population of adults who are the children of immigrants. This paper investigates the migration behavior of these adult children, specifically the 1.5 generation, seeking to answer the question of whether they will remain in the states in which their parent's generation settled or move on. It also assesses whether the out-migration response of the 1.5 generation in states of immigrant concentration is similar to that of their parent's generation or the US-born population""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Should employment authorities worry about mergers and acquisitions?,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper considers the role mergers and acquisitions have on employment. First, it considers the importance of different aspects of compensation policy and human resource management practices for distinguishing acquired and acquiring firms. Second, it examines which individuals from which firms remain with the newly created entity after the takeover. Using a unique employer-employee linked data set for France, we find that very few observable workforce or compensation characteristics distinguish acquired from acquiring firms ex-ante. Nevertheless, the human resources department seems to be quite active in the post-takeover period, with employees of the acquired firm being less likely to remain with the new entity in the short term after takeover than those of the acquiring firm and with the differences between the two types of firms disappearing after 3 years. The workers with characteristics that tend to be associated with the fastest subsequent job finding in the displaced worker literature are also those who tend to be overrepresented among the individuals who separate from their employer post-takeover. Finally, as both acquired and acquiring firms differ from firms not involved in takeover activity in a similar manner, employment authorities may be able to anticipate the regions in which takeovers are more likely to occur by looking at the financial accounts of firms with particular characteristics that have local establishments""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"The rise and fall of Brazilian inequality, 1981-2004",Finance,"""Measured by the Gini coefficient, income inequality in Brazil rose from 0.57 in 1981 to 0.63 in 1989, before falling back to 0.56 in 2004.  This latest figure would lower Brazil's world inequality rank from 2nd (in 1989) to 10th (in 2004).  Poverty incidence also followed an inverted U-curve over the past quarter century, rising from 0.30 in 1981 to 0.33 in 1993, before falling to 0.22 in 2004.  Using standard decomposition techniques, this paper presents a preliminary investigation of the determinants of Brazil's distributional reversal over this period.  The rise in inequality in the 1980s appears to have been driven by increases in the educational attainment of the population in a context of convex returns, and by high and accelerating inflation.  While the secular decline in inequality, which began in 1993, is associated with declining inflation, it also appears to have been driven by four structural and policy changes which have so far not attracted sufficient attention in the literature, namely sharp declines in the returns to education; pronounced rural-urban convergence; increases in social assistance transfers targeted to the poor; and a possible decline in racial inequality.  Although poverty dynamics since the Real Plan of 1994 have been driven primarily by economic growth, the decline in inequality has also made a substantial contribution to poverty reduction.

On defining and measuring the informal sector,Finance,"""A range of alternative empirical definitions of informal activity have been employed in the literature.  Choice of definition is often dictated by data availability.  Different definitions may imply very different conceptual understandings of informality.  In this paper the authors investigate the degree of congruence between three definitions of informality based on employment contract registration, social security protection, and the characteristics of the employer and employment using Brazilian household survey data for the period 1992 to 2001.  The authors present evidence showing that 64 percent of the economically active population are informal according to at least one definition, but only 40 percent are informal according to all three.  Steady compositional changes have been taking place among informal workers, conditional on definition.  The econometric analysis reveals that the conditional impact of particular factors (demographic, educational attainment, and family circumstances) on the likelihood of informality varies considerably from one definition to another.  The results suggest growing heterogeneity within the informal sector.  Therefore, the authors argue that informal activity may be as much associated with entrepreneurial dynamism as with any desire to avoid costly contract registration and social protection.  However, the authors confirm there is no a priori reason for entrepreneurial activity to be unprotected.  Consequently definitions of informality based on occupation and employer size seem the most arbitrary in practice even if conceptually well-founded. ""--World Bank web site."
Energy price shocks and the macroeconomy the role of consumer durables /,Economic theory,"""So far, the literature on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with energy price shocks uses energy on the production side only. In these models, energy shocks are responsible for only a negligible share of output fluctuations. We study the robustness of this finding by explicitly modeling private consumption of energy at the household level in addition to energy use at the firm level to account for total energy use in the economy. Additionally, we distinguish between investment in consumer durables and investment in capital goods. The model economy is calibrated to match total energy use and durable goods consumption as observed in the U.S. data. Simulation results indicate that, despite higher total energy use, this economy has an even smaller proportion of output fluctuations attributable to energy price shocks. Productivity shocks continue to be the primary force behind business cycle fluctuations. The driving force behind our results is that the household now has the flexibility to rebalance its investment portfolio. Specifically, the energy price hike is absorbed by reducing durable goods investment more than investment in capital goods, thereby cushioning the hit to future production at the expense of current consumption. Hence, our model better matches the consumption volatility observed in the data.""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
China's fdi and non-fdi economies and the sustainability of future high chinese growth,Economic theory,"""This paper presents assesses of the contribution of inward FDI to China's recent rapid economic growth using a two stage growth accounting approach.  Recent econometric literature focuses on testing whether Chinese growth depends on inward FDI rather than measuring the contribution.  Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs), often (but not exclusively) are joint ventures between foreign companies and Chinese enterprises, and can be thought of as forming a distinctive subpart of the Chinese economy.  These enterprises account for over 50% of China's exports and 60% of China's imports.  Their share in Chinese GDP has been over 20% in the last two years, but they employ only 3% of the workforce, since their average labor productivity exceeds that of Non-FIEs by around 9:1.  Their production is more heavily for export rather than the domestic market because FIEs provide access to both distribution systems abroad and product design for export markets.  Our decomposition results indicate that China's FIEs may have contributed over 40% of China's economic growth in 2003 and 2004, and without this inward FDI, China's overall GDP growth rate could have been around 3.4 percentage points lower.  We suggest that the sustainability of both China' export and overall economic growth may be questionable if inward FDI plateaus in the future""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
There goes the neighborhood? estimates of the impact of crime risk on property values from megan's laws /,Economic theory,"""We combine data from the housing market with data from the North Carolina Sex Offender Registry to estimate how individuals value living in close proximity to a convicted criminal.  We use the exact location of these offenders to exploit variation in the threat of crime within small homogenous groupings of homes, and we use the timing of sex offenders' arrivals to control for baseline property values in the area.  We find statistically and economically significant negative effects of sex offenders' locations that are extremely localized.  Houses within a one-tenth mile area around the home of a sex offender fall by four percent on average (about $5,500) while those further away show no decline.  These results suggest that individuals have a significant distaste for living in close proximity to a known sex offender.  Using data on crimes committed by sexual offenders against neighbors, we estimate costs to victims of sexual offenses under the assumptions that all of the decline in property value is due to increased crime risk and that neighbors' perceptions of risk are in line with objective data.  We estimate victimization costs of over $1 million far in excess of estimates taken from the criminal justice literature.  However, we cannot reject the alternative hypotheses that individuals overestimate the risk posed by offenders or view living near an offender as having costs exclusive of crime risk""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Product market regulation and endogenous union formation,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""We contribute to the growing literature which aims to link product market regulation and competition to labor market outcomes, in an attempt to explain the divergent US and continental European labor market performance over the past two decades. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we show that the choice of bargaining regime is crucial for the effect of product market competition on unemployment rates, being substantial under collective bargaining and considerably more modest under individual bargaining. Since the choice of bargaining institution is so important, we endogenize it. We find that the bargaining regime which emerges endogenously depends crucially on the degree of product market competition. When product market competition is low, collective bargaining is stable, while individual bargaining emerges as the stable institution under high degrees of product market competition. This also allows us to link product market competition and collective bargaining coverage rates. Our results suggest that the strong decline in collective bargaining coverage and unionization in the US and UK over the last two decades might have been a direct consequence of the Reagan/Thatcher product market reforms of the early 80's. Finally, we calibrate the model to assess the quantitative magnitude of our results. We find that moving from the US low regulation-individual bargaining economy to the EU high regulation-collective bargaining economy leads to a substantial increase in equilibrium unemployment rates from 5.5% to 8.9 % in the model economy""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Sibling death clustering in India state dependence vs. unobserved heterogeneity /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Data from a range of different environments indicate that the incidence of death is not randomly distributed across families but, rather, that there is a clustering of death amongst siblings. A natural explanation of this would be that there are (observed or unobserved) differences across families, for example in genetic frailty, education or living standards. Another hypothesis of considerable interest for both theory and policy is that there is a causal process whereby the death of a child influences the risk of death of the succeeding child in the family. Drawing language from the literature on the economics of unemployment, the causal effect is referred to here as state dependence (or scarring). This paper investigates the extent of state dependence in India, distinguishing this from family-level risk factors common to siblings. It offers a number of methodological innovations upon previous research. Estimates are obtained for each of three Indian states, which exhibit dramatic differences in socio-economic and demographic variables. The results suggest a significant degree of state dependence in each of the three regions. Eliminating scarring, it is estimated, would reduce the incidence of infant mortality (among children born after the first child) by 9.8% in the state of Uttar Pradesh, 6.0% in West Bengal and 5.9% in Kerala""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Rottenberg and the economics of sport after 50 years an evaluation /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Simon Rottenberg's seminal 1956 article in the Journal of Political Economy, 1956, is generally accepted as the starting point for the development of the economics of sport. While he recognised that certain features of professional sports leagues were unusual he saw little reason to treat this industry any differently from a conventional industry. He discusses the importance of uncertainty of outcome, the monopsonistic nature of the labour market, the nature of the product and demand (attendances). He considers alternatives to the reserve clause, such as equal revenue sharing, maximum salary limits, equal market franchise distribution and roster limits. Each of these is rejected in favour of a free market solution which, on the basis of the invariance principle, he suggests will perform just as well as the reserve clause in allocating talent to where it is most productive. The ensuing literature has focused on all these issues, many of which have created considerable debate amongst sports economists. In particular the assumption of profit maximisation has been challenged and a divergence of views, reflected in the so-called North American and European models of sports leagues has emerged. Over the last 50 years sports leagues have expanded, TV markets have opened up and legal challenges to existing practices have multiplied. This paper seeks to evaluate Rottenberg's contribution to a rapidly expanding field and to judge its relevance today""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Monetary unions, external shocks and economic performance a latin american perspective /",Economic theory,"""During the last few years there has been a renewed analysis in currency unions as a form of monetary arrangement.  This new interest has been largely triggered by the Euro experience.  Scholars and policy makers have asked about the optimal number of currencies in the world economy.  They have analyzed whether different countries satisfy the traditional ""optimal currency area"" criteria.  These include, among other: (a) the synchronization of the business cycle; (b) the degree of factor mobility; and (c) the extent of trade and financial integration.  In this paper I analyze the desirability of a monetary union from a Latin American perspective.  First, I review the existing literature on the subject.  Second, I use a large data set to analyze the evidence on economic performance in currency union countries.  I investigate these countries' performance on four dimensions: (a) whether countries without a national currency have a lower occurrence of ""sudden stop"" episodes; (b) whether they have a lower occurrence of ""current account reversal"" episodes; (c) what is their ability to absorb international terms of trade shocks; and (d) what is their ability to absorb ""sudden stops"" and ""current account reversals"" shocks.  I find that belonging to a currency union has not lower the probability of facing a sudden stop or a current account reversal.  I also find that external shocks have been amplified in currency union countries.  The degree of amplification is particularly large when compared to flexible exchange rate countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How does foreign direct investment promote economic growth?exploring the effects of financial markets on linkages,Economic theory,"""The empirical literature finds mixed evidence on the existence of positive productivity externalities in the host country generated by foreign multinational companies.  We propose a mechanism that emphasizes the role of local financial markets in enabling foreign direct investment (FDI) to promote growth through backward linkages, shedding light on this empirical ambiguity.  In a small open economy, final goods production is carried out by foreign and domestic firms, which compete for skilled labor, unskilled labor, and intermediate products.  To operate a firm in the intermediate goods sector, entrepreneurs must develop a new variety of intermediate good, a task that requires upfront capital investments.  The more developed the local financial markets, the easier it is for credit constrained entrepreneurs to start their own firms.  The increase in the number of varieties of intermediate goods leads to positive spillovers to the final goods sector.  As a result financial markets allow the backward linkages between foreign and domestic firms to turn into FDI spillovers.  Our calibration exercises indicate that a) holding the extent of foreign presence constant, financially well-developed economies experience growth rates that are almost twice those of economies with poor financial markets, b) increases in the share of FDI or the relative productivity of the foreign firm leads to higher additional growth in financially developed economies compared to those observed in financially under-developed ones, and c) other local conditions such as market structure and human capital are also important for the effect of FDI on economic growth""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Is mothers' time with their children home production or leisure?,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""As mothers have increased their paid work efforts, conflicts between employment and family responsibilities have grown. This evolution has led researchers to explore more fully the role that caregiving responsibilities play in mothers' time choices. We study this issue using data from the 2003 American Time Use Survey. We estimate a simultaneous four-equation system in which the dependent variables are the number of minutes in a mother's diary day that she devotes to home production, leisure, market work, and caregiving. The first goal of this estimation is to determine if time spent with children responds to prices and demographics more like home production time or leisure. The second goal is to glean a better understanding of the importance that marital status, race, and other demographic factors play in time choices, once economic factors are controlled. Our final goal is to improve upon the existing time use literature by estimating a structural time use model that produces explicit estimates of wage and child care price elasticities. Our results show that mothers' time with their children does not respond to price or demographic changes much like home production or leisure and that, somewhat surprisingly, the caregiving choice responds most like paid labor particularly in the response to higher wages""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
New evidence on the causal link between the quantity and quality of children,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A longstanding question in the economics of the family is the relationship between sibship size and subsequent human capital formation and economic welfare. If there is a causal ""quantity-quality tradeoff,"" then policies that discourage large families should lead to increased human capital, higher earnings, and, at the macro level, promote economic development. Ordinary least squares regression estimates and a large theoretical literature suggest that this is indeed the case. This paper presents new evidence on the child-quantity/child-quality trade-off. Our empirical strategy exploits exogenous variation in family size due to twin births and preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition, as well as ethnic differences in the effects of these variables and preferences for male births in some ethnic groups. We use these sources of variation to look at the causal effect of family size on completed educational attainment, fertility, and earnings. For the purposes of this analysis, we constructed a unique matched data set linking Israeli Census data with information on the demographic structure of families drawn from a population registry. Our results show no evidence of a quantity-quality trade-off, though some estimates from one subsample suggest that first-born girls from large families marry sooner""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Nonparametric tests for treatment effect heterogeneity,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""A large part of the recent literature on program evaluation has focused on estimation of the average effect of the treatment under assumptions of unconfoundedness or ignorability following the seminal work by Rubin (1974) and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983).

It may be of substantive interest to investigate whether there is any subpopulation for which a program or treatment has a nonzero average effect, or whether there is heterogeneity in the effect of the treatment. The hypothesis that the average effect of the treatment is zero for all subpopulations is also important for researchers interested in assessing assumptions concerning the selection mechanism. In this paper we develop two nonparametric tests. The first test is for the null hypothesis that the treatment has a zero average effect for any subpopulation defined by covariates. The second test is for the null hypothesis that the average effect conditional on the covariates is identical for all subpopulations, in other words, that there is no heterogeneity in average treatment effects by covariates. Sacrificing some generality by focusing on these two specific null hypotheses we derive tests that are straightforward to implement""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Empirical estimation results of a collective household time allocation model,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In this paper an empirical model is developed where the collective household model is used as a basic framework to describe the time allocation problem. The collective model views household behavior as the outcome of maximizing a household utility function which is a weighted sum of the utility functions of the male and the female. The empirical research that has been done is mainly focused on testing and refuting the unitary model. Moreover, in the bulk of time allocation literature the main accent still lies on the development of theory. The novelty of this paper is that we empirically estimate the two individual utility functions and the household power weight distribution, which is parameterized per household. The model is estimated on a sub-sample of the British Household Panel Survey, consisting of two-earner households. The empirical results suggest that: (1) Given that the weight distribution is wage dependent, preferences of males and females differ, which rejects the unitary model; (2) The power differences are mainly explained by differences in the ratio of the partners' hourly wages; (3) Although there are significant individual variations on average the power distribution in two-earner families is about even; (4) The male tends to be marginally more productive in performing household tasks than the female (5) The preference for total household production is influenced by family size for the female but not for the male (6) Both males and females have a backward bending labor supply curve""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Local labor markets,Economic theory,"""I examine the causes and the consequences of differences in labor market outcomes across local labor markets within a country.  The focus is on a long-run general equilibrium setting, where workers and firms are free to move across localities and local prices adjust to maintain the spatial equilibrium.  In particular, I develop a tractable general equilibrium framework of local labor markets with heterogenous labor.  This framework is useful in thinking about differences in labor market outcomes of different skill groups across locations.  It clarifies how, in spatial equilibrium, localized shocks to a part of the labor market propagate to the rest of the economy through changes in employment, wages and local prices and how this diffusion affects workers' welfare.  Using this framework, I address three related questions.  First, I analyze the welfare consequences of productivity differences across local labor markets.  I seek to understand what happens to the wage, employment and utility of workers with different skill levels when a local economy experiences a shift in the productivity of a group of workers.  Second, I analyze the causes of productivity differences across local labor markets.  To a large extent, productivity differences within a country are unlikely to be exogenous.  I review the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies, with a particular focus on studies that are relevant for labor economists.  Finally, I discuss the implications for policy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A semiparametric approach for analyzing nonignorable missing data,Economic theory,"""In missing data analysis, there is often a need to assess the sensitivity of key inferences to departures from untestable assumptions regarding the missing data process.  Such sensitivity analysis often requires specifying a missing data model which commonly assumes parametric functional forms for the predictors of missingness.  In this paper, we relax the parametric assumption and investigate the use of a generalized additive missing data model.  We also consider the possibility of a non-linear relationship between missingness and the potentially missing outcome, whereas the existing literature commonly assumes a more restricted linear relationship.  To avoid the computational complexity, we adopt an index approach for local sensitivity.  We derive explicit formulas for the resulting semiparametric sensitivity index.  The computation of the index is simple and completely avoids the need to repeatedly fit the semiparametric nonignorable model.  Only estimates from the standard software analysis are required with a moderate amount of additional computation.  Thus, the semiparametric index provides a fast and robust method to adjust the standard estimates for nonignorable missingness.  An extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate the effects of misspecifying the missing data model and to compare the performance of the proposed approach with the commonly used parametric approaches.  The simulation study shows that the proposed method helps reduce bias that might arise from the misspecification of the functional forms of predictors in the missing data model.  We illustrate the method in a Wage Offer dataset""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Consumer spending and the economic stimulus payments of 2008,Economic theory,"""We measure the response of household spending to the economic stimulus payments (ESPs) disbursed in mid-2008, using special questions added to the Consumer Expenditure Survey and variation arising from the randomized timing of when the payments were disbursed.  We find that, on average, households spent about 12-30% (depending on the specification) of their stimulus payments on non-durable expenditures during the three-month period in which the payments were received.  Further, there was also a significant increase in spending on durable goods, in particular vehicles, bringing the average total spending response to about 50-90% of the payments.  Relative to research on the 2001 tax rebates, these spending responses are estimated with greater precision using the randomized timing variation.  The estimated responses are substantial and significant for older, lower-income, and home-owning households.  We further extend the literature in two ways.  First, we find little evidence that the propensity to spend varies with the method of disbursement (paper check versus electronic transfer).  Second, we evaluate a complementary methodology for quantifying the impact of tax cuts, which asks consumers to self-report whether they spent their tax cuts.  The response of spending to the ESPs is indeed largest for self-reported spenders.  However, self-reported savers also spent a significant fraction of the payments""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Institutional requirements for effective imposition of fines,Economic theory,"""A long theoretical literature in economics addresses the heavy reliance of the U.S.  criminal justice system on very expensive forms of punishment - prison - when cheaper alternatives - such as fines and other sanctions - are available.  This paper analyzes the role of fines as a criminal sanction within the existing institutional structure of criminal justice agencies, modeling heterogeneity in how people respond to various sanctions and threat of sanctions.  From research on the application of fines in the U.S., we conclude that fines are economical only in relation to other forms of punishment; for many crimes fines will work well for the majority of offenders but fail miserably for a significant minority; that fines present a number of very significant administrative challenges; and that the political economy of fine imposition and collection is complex.  Despite these facts, and with the caveats that jurisdictions vary tremendously and that there are large gaps in our knowledge about them, we build a model showing that it is possible to expand the use of fines as a criminal sanction if institutional structures are developed with these concerns in mind.Published: Anne Morrison Piehl & Geoffrey Williams, 2010.""Institutional Requirements for Effective Imposition of Fines,""NBER Chapters,in: Controlling Crime: Strategies and TradeoffsNational Bureau of Economic Research, Inc""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Are household surveys like tax forms evidence from income underreporting of the self employed /,Economic theory,"""There is a large literature showing that the self employed underreport their income to tax authorities.  In this paper, we quantify the extent to which the self employed systematically underreport their income to U.S.  household surveys.  To do so, we use the Engel curve describing the relationship between income and expenditures of wage and salary workers to infer the actual income, and thus the reporting gap, of the self employed based on their reported expenditures.  We find that the self employed underreport their income by about 30 percent.  This result is remarkably robust across data sources and alternative model specifications.  Aside from transportation expenditures, we find little evidence that the self employed misreport their expenditures to household surveys.  We show that failing to account for such income underreporting leads to biased conclusions when comparing the earnings and saving behavior between the self employed and other workers as well as biased estimates of the importance of precautionary savings, the shape of lifecycle earnings profiles, and the magnitude of earnings differences across MSAs.  Finally, our results show that it is naive for researchers to take it for granted that individuals will provide unbiased information to household surveys when they are simultaneously providing distorted information to other administrative sources""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The contribution of the minimum wage to U.S. wage inequality over three decades a reassessment /,Economic theory,"""We reassess the effect of state and federal minimum wages on U.S.  earnings inequality, attending to two issues that appear to bias earlier work: violation of the assumed independence of state wage levels and state wage dispersion, and errors-in-variables that inflate impact estimates via an analogue of the well known division bias problem.  We find that erosion of the real minimum wage raises inequality in the lower tail of the wage distribution (the 50/10 wage ratio), but the impacts are typically less than half as large as those reported in the literature and are almost negligible for males.  Nevertheless, the estimated effects of the minimum wage on points of the wage distribution extend to wage percentiles where the minimum is nominally non-binding, implying spillovers.  We structurally estimate these spillovers and show that their relative importance grows as the nominal minimum wage becomes less binding.  Subsequent analysis underscores, however, that spillovers and measurement error (absent spillovers) have similar implications for the effect of the minimum on the shape of the lower tail of the measured wage distribution.  With available precision, we cannot reject the hypothesis that estimated spillovers to non-binding percentiles are due to reporting artifacts.  Accepting this null, the implied effect of the minimum wage on the actual wage distribution is smaller than the effect of the minimum wage on the measured wage distribution""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Under pressure job security, resource allocation, and productivity in schools under NCLB /",Economic theory,"""The most sweeping federal education law in decades, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, requires states to administer standardized exams and to punish schools that do not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for the fraction of students passing these exams.  While the literature on school accountability is well-established, there exists no nationwide study of the strong short-term incentives created by NCLB for schools on the margin of failing AYP.  We assemble the first comprehensive, national, school-level dataset concerning detailed performance measures used to calculate AYP, and demonstrate that idiosyncrasies in state policies create numerous cases where schools near the margin for satisfying their own state's AYP requirements would have almost certainly failed or almost certainly made AYP if they were located in other states.  Using this variation as a means of identification, we examine the impact of NCLB on the behavior of school personnel and students' academic achievement in nationally representative samples.  We find that accountability pressure from NCLB lowers teachers' perceptions of job security and causes untenured teachers in high-stakes grades to work longer hours than their peers.  We also find that NCLB pressure has either neutral or positive effects on students' enjoyment of learning and their achievement gains on low-stakes exams in reading, math, and science""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
How important are financing constraints ? the role of finance in the business environment,Finance,"""What role does the business environment play in promoting and restraining firm growth? Recent literature points to a number of factors as obstacles to growth.  Inefficient functioning of financial markets, inadequate security and enforcement of property rights, poor provision of infrastructure, inefficient regulation and taxation, and broader governance features such as corruption and macroeconomic stability are discussed without any comparative evidence on their ordering.  In this paper, the authors use firm level survey data to present evidence on the relative importance of different features of the business environment.  They find that although firms report many obstacles to growth, not all the obstacles are equally constraining.  Some affect firm growth only indirectly through their influence on other obstacles, or not at all.  Using Directed Acyclic Graph methodology as well as regressions, the authors find that only obstacles related to finance, crime, and political instability directly affect the growth rate of firms.  Robustness tests further show that the finance result is the most robust of the three.  These results have important policy implications for the priority of reform efforts.  They show that maintaining political stability, keeping crime under control, and undertaking financial sector reforms to relax financing constraints are likely to be the most effective routes to promote firm growth.

Nonlinear effects of altitude on child growth in Peru a multilevel analysis /,Finance,"""Growth at high altitude has been the object of many investigations after experimental studies on animals showed that hypoxia at high altitude slows growth.  Many studies have also looked at the Andean populations and found different results.  Even though a few studies find that individuals living at high altitudes are smaller than the ones living at low altitudes, a significant group of studies does not reveal such a clear relationship.  This study focuses on Peru, a country characterized by a diverse territory, great altitude variations, and a population with a wide socioeconomic gradient.  The analysis differs from previous studies in three ways.  First, in an attempt to reconcile the main findings of the biological literature with the economic models of child health, it explores the relationship between altitude and child health within a multivariate framework.  Second, it benefits from a large spectrum of altitude data and does not concentrate on one or two isolated villages.  Third, it takes into account the cluster nature of the data and controls for correlation of variables in the same cluster through multilevel statistical modeling.  After controlling for characteristics of the children, families, and communities, the data show a significant nonlinear relationship between altitude and child nutritional status.  Peruvian children living at medium/high altitudes appear to be worse off than children living at extremely high altitudes, where the negative effect of hypoxia on growth could be compensated by other favorable health and environmental conditions.

Do home computers improve educational outcomes? evidence from matched current population surveys and the national longitudinal survey of youth 1997,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Nearly twenty million children in the United States do not have computers in their homes. The role of home computers in the educational process, however, has drawn very little attention in the previous literature. We use panel data from the two main U.S. datasets that include recent information on computer ownership among children -- the 2000-2003 CPS Computer and Internet Use Supplements (CIUS) matched to the CPS Basic Monthly Files and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 -- to explore the relationship between computer ownership and high school graduation and other educational outcomes. Teenagers who have access to home computers are 6 to 8 percentage points more likely to graduate from high school than teenagers who do not have home computers after controlling for individual, parental, and family characteristics. We generally find evidence of positive relationships between home computers and educational outcomes using several estimation strategies, including controlling for typically unobservable home environment and extracurricular activities in the NLSY97, fixed effects models, instrumental variables, future computer ownership and ""pencil tests"". Some of these estimation techniques, however, provide imprecise estimates. Home computers may increase high school graduation by reducing non-productive activities, such as truancy and crime, among children in addition to making it easier to complete school assignments""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Minimum wages and firm profitability,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Although there is a large literature on the economic effects of minimum wages on labour market outcomes (especially employment), there is hardly any evidence on their impact on firm performance. This is surprising: minimum wages appear to have a significant impact on wages, but only a limited impact on jobs, so it is natural to imagine there must be a stronger impact on other aspects of firm behaviour. In this paper we consider the impact of minimum wages on firm profitability by exploiting the introduction of a minimum wage to the UK labour market in 1999. We use pre-policy information on the distribution of wages to construct treatment and comparison groups and implement a difference in differences approach. We show evidence that firm profitability was significantly reduced (and wages significantly raised) by the minimum wage introduction. This emerges from separate analyses of two distinct types of firm level panel data (one on firms in a very low wage sector, UK residential care homes, and a second on firms across all sectors). Interestingly, we find no evidence that the profitability reductions resulted in increases in firm exit, so our findings may be consistent with redistribution of quasi-rents towards low wage employees""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"CEO turnover, firm performance and enterprise reform in China evidence from new micro data /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""Using comprehensive financial and accounting data on China's listed firms from 1998 to 2002, augmented by unique data on CEO turnover, ownership structure and board characteristics, we estimate Logit models of CEO turnover. We find consistently for all performance measures including both stock return and various accounting measures that: (i) overall, CEO turnover is significantly and inversely related to firm performance though the magnitude of the relationship is modest; (ii) CEO turnover-performance link is stronger when the percentage of company shares owned by the largest shareholder is larger. Furthermore, insofar as stock performance is concerned, (iii) turnover-performance link is found to be weaker for listed firms still controlled by the state; (iv) the appointment of independent directors enhances turnover-performance link; (v) the listing suspension mechanism, i.e., the ST designation, adopted by China's securities regulatory agency appears to be effective in improving turnover-performance tie; and (vi) listed firms with CEOs holding additional positions in the controlling shareholders have weaker turnover-performance link. Consistent with the ""law and finance"" approach to corporate governance and the literature on economic transition, our findings suggest that any fundamental improvement in China's corporate governance will require a broad program that encompasses not only privatization but also laws and their effective implementation to provide better protection for investors""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"International capital flows, returns, and world financial integration",Economic theory,"""International capital flows have increased dramatically since the 1980s, with much of the increase being due to trade in equity and debt markets.  Such developments are often attributed to the increased integration of world financial markets.  We present a model that allows us to examine how greater integration in world financial markets affects the behavior of international capital flows and financial returns.  Our model predicts that international capital flows are large (in absolute value) and very volatile during the early stages of financial integration when international asset trading is concentrated in bonds.  As integration progresses and households gain access to world equity markets, the size and volatility of international bond flows fall dramatically but continue to exceed the size and volatility of international equity flows.  This is the natural outcome of greater risk sharing facilitated by increased integration.  We find that the equilibrium flows in bonds and stocks are larger than their empirical counterparts, and are largely driven by variations in equity risk premia.  The paper also makes a methodological contribution to the literature on dynamic general equilibrium asset-pricing.  We implement a new technique for solving a dynamic general equilibrium model with production, portfolio choice and incomplete markets""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Towards new open economy macroeconometrics,Economic theory,"""I develop a model that improves upon the recent literature in open economy macroeconomics in that it lends itself more directly to empirical investigation.  I solve the stationarity problem that characterizes many existing models by adopting an overlapping generations structure  ̉la Weil (1989).  I model nominal rigidity by assuming that firms face explicit costs of output price inflation volatility.  The specification generates an endogenous markup that fluctuates over the business cycle.  I identify the two economies in my model with Canada--a small open economy--and the United States--taken as an approximation of the rest-of-the-world economy.  In the second part of the paper, I present a plausible strategy for estimating the structural parameters of the Canadian economy.  I do so by using nonlinear least squares at the single-equation level.  Estimates of most parameters are characterized by small standard errors and are in line with the findings of other studies.  I also develop a plausible way of constructing measures for nonobservable variables.  To verify if multiple-equation regressions yield significantly different estimates, I run full information maximum likelihood, system-wide regressions.  The results of the two procedures are similar.  Finally, I illustrate a practical application of the model, showing how a shock to the U.S.  economy is transmitted to Canada under an inflation-targeting monetary regime""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Rethinking the gains from immigration theory and evidence from the U.S. /,Economic theory,"""Recent influential empirical work has emphasized the negative impact immigrants have on the wages of U.S.-born workers, arguing that immigration harms less educated American workers in particular and all U.S.-born workers in general.  Because U.S. and foreign born workers belong to different skill groups that are imperfectly substitutable, one needs to articulate a production function that aggregates different types of labor (and accounts for complementarity and substitution effects) in order to calculate the various effects of immigrant labor on U.S.-born labor.  We introduce such a production function, making the crucial assumption that U.S. and foreign-born workers with similar education and experience levels may nevertheless be imperfectly substitutable, and allowing for endogenous capital accumulation.  This function successfully accounts for the negative impact of the relative skill levels of immigrants on the relative wages of U.S.  workers.  However, contrary to the findings of previous literature, overall immigration generates a large positive effect on the average wages of U.S.-born workers.  We show evidence of this positive effect by estimating the impact of immigration on both average wages and housing values across U.S.  metropolitan areas (1970-2000).  We also reproduce this positive effect by simulating the behavior of average wages and housing prices in an open city-economy, with optimizing U.S.-born agents who respond to an inflow of foreign-born workers of the size and composition comparable to the immigration of the 1990s""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Innovation and development around the world, 1960-2000",Finance,"""The authors present a database of indicators of innovative activity around the world since the early 1960s.  The data include measures of innovation outcomes as well as variables related to innovation effort.  The main indicator of innovation outputs is patents.  The main variables related to innovation inputs are investment in research and development (R&D) and technical personnel (engineers, scientists) working in R&D activities.  The sources of these data are publicly available (OECD, UNESCO, etc.), yet there have been few attempts at double checking the consistency of these data and digitizing observations dating back to the 1960s.  After discussing the sources and definitions of the data, the authors examine trends and patterns of innovation outputs and inputs by looking at the over-time behavior of the relevant series and comparing the performance of developing and high-income countries.  They also provide cross-regional comparisons and a detailed examination of trends in selected countries.  In turn, the authors provide estimates of the impact of innovation on long-run development by following an emerging empirical literature on the determinants of levels of GDP per capita.  The econometric results suggest that innovation might indeed have strong positive effects on long-run development, which might be stronger than the direct effects of institutions.  The analysis pays close attention to issues related to the potential endogeneity of innovation (and institutions) with respect to the level of development. ""--World Bank web site."
How's the job? well-being and social capital in the workplace /,Economic theory,"""This paper takes a different tack in addressing one of the fundamental questions in economics: what are the factors that determine the distribution of jobs and wages? In Adam Smith's classic formulation, and in much of the subsequent literature, wage levels have been used to estimate the values of job characteristics (""compensating"" or ""equalizing"" differentials).  There are econometric problems with this approach, principally caused by unmeasured differences in talents and aptitudes that enable people of high ability to have jobs with both high wages and good working conditions, thus understating the value of working conditions.  We bypass this difficulty by estimating the extent to which incomes and job characteristics influence direct measures of life satisfaction from three large and recent Canadian surveys.  The well-being results show strikingly large values for non-financial job characteristics, especially workplace trust and other measures of the quality of workplace social capital.  The compensating differentials estimated for the quality of workplace social capital are so large as to suggest that they do not reflect a full equilibrium.  Thus the current situation probably reflects the existence of unrecognized opportunities for managers and employees to alter workplace environments, or for workers to change jobs, so as to increase both life satisfaction and workplace efficiency""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Exchange rate forecasting the errors we've really made /,Finance,"""We examine the forecasting performance of standard macro models of exchange rates in real time, using dozens of different vintages of the OECD's Main Economic Indicators database.  We calculate out-of-sample forecasts as they would have been made at the time, and compare them to a random walk alternative.  The resulting ""time series"" of forecast performance indicates that both data revisions and changes in the sample period typically have large effects on exchange rate predictability.  We show that the favorable evidence of long-horizon exchange rate predictability for the DM and Yen in Mark (1995) is present in only a narrow two-year window of data vintages around that used by Mark.  In addition, approximately one-third of the improved forecasting performance of Mark's monetary model over a random walk is eventually undone by data revisions.  Related to this, we find the models consistently perform better using original release data than using fully revised data.  Finally, we find that model-based exchange rate forecasts are sometimes better when using Federal Reserve Staff forecasts of future fundamentals instead of actual future values of fundamentals.  This contradicts a cherished presumption in the literature that dates all the way back to Meese and Rogoff (1983)""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
The high-frequency response of exchange rates and interest rates to macroeconomic announcements,Finance,"""Many recent papers have studied movements in stock, bond, and currency prices over short windows of time around macro announcements.  This paper adds to the announcement effects literature in two ways.  First, we study the joint announcement effects across a broad range of assets--exchange rates and U.S.  and foreign term structures.  In order to evaluate whether the joint effects can be reconciled with conventional theory, we interpret the joint movements in light of uncovered interest rate parity or changes in risk premia.  For several real macro announcements, we find that a stronger than expected release appreciates the dollar today, but that it must either (i) lower the relative risk premium for holding foreign currency rather than dollars, or (ii) imply considerable future expected dollar depreciation.  The latter implies an overshooting behavior akin to that described by Dornbusch (1976).  Second, we use a longer span of high frequency data than has been common in announcement work.  A longer span of high frequency data contributes to the precision of our estimates and allows us to explore the possibility that the effects of macro surprises on asset prices have varied over time.  We find evidence, for example, that PPI releases had a larger effect on U.S.  interest rates before about 1992 than subsequently""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Monetary union, price level convergence, and inflation how close is Europe to the United States? /",Finance,"""In light of 50 years of economic policies designed to integrate Europe -- culminating in the elimination of euro zone national currencies in early 2002 -- and a vast academic literature on international economic integration, it is of interest to assess how far European integration has come in practice.  Using a unique data set, I document the pattern of price dispersion across European and U.S. cities from 1990 to 2001.  I find a striking decline in dispersion for traded goods prices in Europe, most of which took place between 1991 and 1994.  The level of traded goods price dispersion in the euro area is now quite close to that of the United States.  A decline in dispersion of non-tradeables prices in Europe has also taken place, but to a smaller extent.  For U.S. cities, there is no evidence of a decline in price dispersion, even for tradeables.  I examine several possible explanations for the decline in European price dispersion, including harmonization of tax rates, convergence of incomes and labor costs, liberalization of trade and factor markets, and increased coherence of monetary policy.  I also investigate how much of the variation in national inflation rates in Europe can be explained by price level convergence.  Finally, after showing that prices in likely next-round entrants into the euro zone are well below prices in Western Europe, I discuss the potential inflationary consequences of accession into monetary union for Eastern Europe""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"The scaling-up of microfinance in Bangladesh determinants, impact, and lessons /",Finance,"""The microfinance industry in Bangladesh currently provides access to credit to around 13 million poor households.  Zaman describes the factors that led to the scaling-up of micro-credit in Bangladesh, the impact this has had on the poor, future challenges in Bangladesh, and possible lessons for other countries. The consensus in the literature is that micro-credit plays a significant role in reducing household vulnerability to a number of risks and that it contributes to improving social indicators.  The author argues that strategic donor investments in a handful of well-managed institutions that offer a simple, easily replicable financial product could lead to large gains in access to finance for the poor.  However, this approach could sacrifice other objectives of financial sector development, such as product and institutional diversity, which could be promoted after the initial expansion has taken place.  Governments can also have a crucial role in promoting access to microfinance by ensuring macroeconomic stability, enforcing a simple regulatory structure, and developing communications networks that reduce transaction costs.  Another lesson is that while visionary leadership cannot simply be franchised, the internal management systems that led to the scaling-up can be replicated in other settings.

Predicting the poverty impacts of trade reform,Finance,"""An important area of research in recent years involves assessing the microeconomic implications of macro-level policies--particularly those related to international trade.  While a wide range of research methodologies are available for assessing the microeconomic incidence of micro-policies, as well as for assessing the effect of macro-level policies on markets and broad groups of households, there is a gap when it comes to eliciting the disaggregated household and firm level effects of trade policies.  Recent research addresses this knowledge gap and the present survey offers an overview of this literature.  The preponderance of the evidence from the studies encompassed by this survey points to the dominance of earnings-side effects over consumption-side effects of trade reform.  This is problematic, since household surveys are notable for their underreporting of income.  From the perspective of the poor, it is the market for unskilled labor that is most important.  The poverty effects of trade policy often hinge crucially on how well the increased demand for labor in one part of the economy is transmitted to the rest of the economy by way of increased wages, increased employment, or both.  Further econometric research aimed at discriminating between competing factor mobility hypotheses is urgently needed.

Has private participation in water and sewerage improved coverage? empirical evidence from Latin America,Finance,"""Introducing private sector participation (PSP) into the water and sewerage sectors in developing countries is difficult and controversial.  Empirical studies on its effects are scant and generally inconclusive.  Case studies tend to find improvements in the sector following privatization, but they suffer from selection bias and it is difficult to generalize their results.  To explore empirically the effects of PSP on coverage, Clarke, Kosec, and Wallsten assemble a new dataset of connections to water and sewerage services at the city and province level based on household surveys in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.  The household surveys, conducted over a number of years, allow them to compile data before and after the introduction of PSP, as well as from similar (control) regions that never privatized at all.  Their analysis reveals that, in general, connection rates to piped water and sewerage improved following the introduction of PSP, consistent with the case study literature.  The authors also find, however, that connection rates similarly improved in the control regions, suggesting that PSP may not have been responsible for those improvements.  On the other hand, connection rates for the poorest households also tended to increase in the regions with PSP and in the control regions, suggesting that--in terms of connections at least--PSP did not harm the poor.

The long-term legacy of the Khmer Rouge period in Cambodia,Finance,"""De Walque studies the long-term impact of genocide during the period of the Khmer Rouge (1975¡79) in Cambodia and contributes to the literature on the economic analysis of conflict.  Using mortality data for siblings from the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey in 2000, he shows that excess mortality was extremely high and heavily concentrated during 1974¡80.  Adult males had been the most likely to die, indicating that violent death played a major role.  Individuals with an urban or educated background were more likely to die.  Infant mortality was also at very high levels during the period, and disability rates from landmines or other weapons were high for males who, given their birth cohort, were exposed to this risk.  The very high and selective mortality had a major impact on the population structure of Cambodia.  Fertility and marriage rates were very low under the Khmer Rouge but rebounded immediately after the regime's collapse.  Because of the shortage of eligible males, the age and education differences between partners tended to decline.  The period had a lasting impact on the educational attainment of the population.  The education system collapsed during the period, so individuals--especially males--who were of schooling age during this interval had a lower educational attainment than the preceding and subsequent birth cohorts.

These data show that the New England, Middle Atlantic, Pacific, East North Central, and West North Central regions have been educational leaders during the entire time period.  In contrast, the South Atlantic, East South Central, and West South Central regions have been educational laggards.  The Mountain region behaves differently than either of the aforementioned groups.  Using their estimates of average years of schooling and average years of experience in the labor force, the authors estimate aggregate Mincerian earnings regressions.  Their estimates indicate that a year of schooling increased output by between 8 percent and 12 percent, with a point estimate close to 10 percent.  These estimates are in line with the body of evidence from the labor literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Is marriage poisonous? / Are relationships taxing? an analysis of the male marital wage differential in Denmark /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The word for 'married' in Danish is the same as the word for 'poison'. The word for 'sweetheart' in Danish is the same as the word for 'tax'. In this paper we expand upon the literature documenting a significant marital wage premium for men in the United States to see if a similar differential exists for married men in Denmark - or if the homonyms have perhaps less of a double meaning. Unlike most other research in this area, our study is based on a large panel sample with complete relationship histories, consisting of about 35,000 young Danish men observed before and after their first marriage or cohabitation during the years 1984-2001. Since the majority of young Danes cohabit before they marry, if they ever marry, cohabitation is allowed for as a separate state. Pooled OLS estimates indicate a marital wage premium of 4-5%, which drops to 2% after controlling for selectivity. The cohabitation premium is found to be of the same size as the marital wage premium. Our results indicate that a part of the marriage or cohabitation premium is not due to marriage or cohabitation itself, but to fatherhood. When information on becoming a father and years spent in fatherhood is added to the empirical model, the results show that fathers receive a 'fatherhood' premium during their first few years as fathers and that the initial marital wage premium is reduced""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Vive la révolution! long term returns of 1968 to the angry students,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The famous events of May 1968, starting with student riots, threw France into a state of turmoil. The period of 'revolution' coincided with the time in which important examinations are undertaken. Normal procedures were abandoned and the pass-rate for various qualifications increased enormously. These events were particularly important for students at an early (and highly selective) phase of higher education. They are shown to have pursued further years of education because thresholds were lowered at critical stages. These historic events provide a natural experiment to analyse the returns to years of higher education for the affected generation and to consider consequences for their children. Thus, we contribute to debate on two very controversial questions: What is the true causal relationship between educational attainment and its labour market value? Is there a causal relationship between the education of parents and that of their children? Unlike most of the literature, we consider the effect of an intervention which alters an individual's years of higher education rather than compulsory schooling. The results show a relatively high return, which might indicate that private returns are higher for the former. Furthermore, the treatment group is on the margin of the higher education system. This study suggests that expanding the university system to accommodate such people can yield very high private returns. Hence our study suggests very positive effects of the '1968 events' for affected cohorts and is of contemporary relevance given the current debate in many countries about widening access to higher education""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
What remains from the Volcker experiment?,Economic theory,"""Under conventional representations of economic policymaking, any innovation is either (1) a change in the objectives that policymakers are seeking to achieve, (2) a change in the choice of policy instrument, or (3) a change in the way auxiliary aspects of economic activity are used to steer policy in the context of time lags.Most public discussion of the 1979 Volcker experiment at the time, and likewise most of the subsequent academic literature, emphasized either the role of quantitative targets for money growth (3) or the use of an open market operating procedure based on a reserves quantity rather than a short-term interest rate (2).  With time, however, neither has survived as part of U.S.  monetary policymaking.What remains is the question of whether 1979 brought a new, greater weight on the Federal Reserve%u2019s objective of price stability vis-a-vis its objective of output growth and high employment (1).  That is certainly one interpretation of the historical record.  But the historical evidence is also consistent with the view that the 1970s were exceptional, rather than that the experience since 1979 has differed from what went before as a whole""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a medium-scale macroeconomic model expanded version /,Economic theory,"""In this paper, we study Ramsey-optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a medium-scale model of the U.S.\ business cycle.  The model features a rich array of real and nominal rigidities that have been identified in the recent empirical literature as salient in explaining observed aggregate fluctuations.  The main result of the paper is that price stability appears to be a central goal of optimal monetary policy.  The optimal rate of inflation under an income tax regime is half a percent per year with a volatility of 1.1 percent.  This result is surprising given that the model features a number of frictions that in isolation would call for a volatile rate of inflation---particularly nonstate-contingent nominal public debt, no lump-sum taxes, and sticky wages.Under an income-tax regime, the optimal income tax rate is quite stable, with a mean of 30 percent and a standard deviation of 1.1 percent.  Simple monetary and fiscal rules are shown to implement a competitive equilibrium that mimics well the one induced by the Ramsey policy.  When the fiscal authority is allowed to tax capital and labor income at different rates, optimal fiscal policy is characterized by a large and volatile subsidy on capital""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The empirical risk-return relation a factor analysis approach /,Economic theory,"""A key criticism of the existing empirical literature on the risk-return relation relates to the relatively small amount of conditioning information used to model the conditional mean and conditional volatility of excess stock market returns.  To the extent that financial market participants have information not reflected in the chosen conditioning variables, measures of conditional mean and conditional volatility--and ultimately the risk-return relation itself--will be misspecified and possibly highly misleading.  We consider one remedy to these problems using the methodology of dynamic factor analysis for large datasets, whereby a large amount of economic information can be summarized by a few estimated factors.  We find that three new factors, a ""volatility,"" ""risk premium,"" and ""real"" factor, contain important information about one-quarter ahead excess returns and volatility that is not contained in commonly used predictor variables.  Moreover, the factor-augmented specifications we examine predict an unusual 16-20 percent of the one-quarter ahead variation in excess stock market returns, and exhibit remarkably stable and strongly statistically significant out-of-sample forecasting power.  Finally, in contrast to several pre-existing studies that rely on a small number of conditioning variables, we find a positive conditional correlation between risk and return that is strongly statistically significant, whereas the unconditional correlation is weakly negative and statistically insignificant""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Global monetary conditions versus country-specific factors in the determination of emerging market debt spreads,Finance,"""The authors offer evidence that U.S. interest rate policy has an important influence in the determination of credit spreads on emerging market bonds over U.S.  benchmark treasuries and therefore on their cost of capital.  Their analysis improves on the existing literature and understanding by addressing the dynamics of market expectations in shaping views on interest rate and monetary policy changes and by recognizing nonlinearities in the link between U.S.  interest rates and emerging market bond spreads, as the level of interest rates affect the market's perceived probability of default and the solvency of emerging market borrowers.  For a country with a moderate level of debt, repayment prospects would remain good in the face of an increase in U.S.  interest rates, so there would be little increase in spreads.  A country close to the borderline of solvency would face a steeper increase in spreads.  Simulations of a 200 basis points (bps) increase in U.S.  interest rates show an increase in emerging market spreads ranging from 6 bps to 65 bps, depending on debt/GDP ratios.  This would be in addition to the increase in the benchmark U.S.  10 year Treasury rate. ""--World Bank web site."
Resistance to multilateral influence on reform the political backlash against private infrastructure investments /,Finance,"""Coercive isomorphism is a prominent source of institutional change.  The literature to date has emphasized how actors that are powerful and legitimate (for example, a national government) may coerce the adoption of reforms by dependent actors (for example, state governments and other organizations whose activities are governed by the federal government).  The authors observe that an actor's power alone may be sufficient to promote reform, regardless of the actor's legitimacy.  But such reforms are more susceptible to subsequent change than those that emerge from processes not subject to the influence of external actors whose sway derives from their power alone.  They develop and test their arguments in the context of the worldwide electricity provision industry by analyzing countries' adoption of reforms in response to conditional lending practices by multilateral organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  The authors find that reforms adopted in response to coercive pressures exerted by these organizations encounter much greater resistance, and that the incidence of financial and economic crises, the absence of checks and balances in established political institutions, and the inexperience of investor coalitions dramatically increase the predicted level of resistance.

Governance and the city an empirical exploration into global determinants of urban performance /,Finance,"""The authors contribute to the field of urban governance and globalization through an empirically-based exploration of determinants of the performance of cities.  They construct a preliminary worldwide database for cities, containing variables and indicators of globalization (at the country and city level), city governance, city performance (access and quality of infrastructure service delivery), as well as other relevant city characteristics.  This city database, encompassing hundreds of cities worldwide, integrates existing data with new data gathered for this research.  The findings suggest that good governance and globalization (at both the country and city level) do matter for city-level performance in terms of access and quality of delivery of infrastructure services.  The authors also find that globalization and good city governance are significantly related with each other.  Furthermore, the evidence suggests that there are complex interactions between technology choices, governance, and city performance, as well as evidence of a nonlinear (U-shaped) relationship between city size and performance, challenging the view that very large cities necessarily exhibit lower performance and pointing instead to potential agglomeration economies.  The framework also suggests a way of bridging two seemingly competing strands of the literature, namely viewing the city as a place or as an outcome.  The authors conclude by pointing to the need for expanding the database and the econometric framework, and suggest research directions and policy implications emerging from this initial investigation on governance and the city.

Bargaining and specialization in marriage,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Can households make efficient choices? The fact that cohabitation and marriage are partnerships for joint production and consumption imply that their gains are highest when household members cooperate. At the same time, empirical findings suggest that spousal specialization and labor force attachment do influence the threat points of each spouse. As a consequence, specialization and spousal cooperation can be costly for household members. While the existing literature is divided on whether household choices are made efficiently or not, there does not yet exist an attempt to identify the marriage market and household dynamics that could induce endogenous cooperation and efficiency within the households. This paper incorporates the process of spousal matching into a household labor supply model in which (a) couples engage in home production, (b) there are potential gains from specialization but specializing in home production lowers market wages, and (c) intra-marital allocations are determined by an endogenous sharing rule that is driven by actual wage earnings. The incentives to specialize are high when wage or spousal endowment inequality is relatively high. Still, when there are equal numbers of men and women in the marriage markets, spousal specialization may not occur unless there exists a commitment mechanism. However, when the sex ratio is not equal to unity and there are singles in equilibrium who are of the same sex as spouses that specialize in market production, matching in asymmetric marriage markets induces spousal cooperation and specialization""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Introduction and summary to the handbook of trade policy and WTO accession for development in Russia and the CIS,Finance,"""This paper is the introduction and summary chapter of the 43 chapter volume entitled Handbook of Trade Policy and WTO Accession for Development in Russia and the CIS.  The key policy conclusions of each of the chapters are highlighted in this paper.  The Handbook will be published only in Russian in 2005, but an English language version of the majority of the papers described here is available on the website www.worldbank.org/trade/russia-wto.  This paper first explains the potential importance of World Trade Organization (WTO) accession as a development tool, and discusses the recent successful development models and the role of trade policy in their development.  The paper then summarizes the three parts of the Handbook.  The first part treats trade policy (with applications to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS]).  The second part treats World Trade Organization institutions and disciplines, again with Russia and CIS applications.  And the third part focuses on various aspects of the impact of WTO accession on Russia.  The numerous papers that relate trade policy and WTO accession to experience in Russia and the CIS are likely to be of special interest to native English speakers, since these papers are new to the literature.  The papers in the Handbook are intended to be non-technical materials accessible to a wide policy audience.  The Handbook forms the basis of a World Bank Institute course on trade policy and WTO accession, which has been delivered and will be delivered again on multiple occasions. ""--World Bank web site."
The public pay gap in Britain small differences that (don't?) matter /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The existing literature on inequality between private and public sectors focuses on cross-section differences in earnings levels. A more general way of looking at inequality between sectors is to recognize that forward-looking agents will care about income and job mobility too. We show that these are substantially different between the two sectors. Using data from the BHPS, we estimate a model of income and employment dynamics over seven years. We allow for unobserved heterogeneity in the propensity to be unemployed or employed in either job sector and in terms of the income process. We then combine the results into lifetime values of jobs in either sector and carry out a cross-section comparative analysis of these values. We have four main findings. First focusing on cross-sector differences in terms of the income process only, we detect a positive average public premium both in income flows and in the present discounted sum of future income flows. Second, most of the observed relative income compression in the public sector is due to a lower variance of the transitory component of income. Third, when taking job mobility into account, the lifetime public premium is essentially zero for workers that we categorize as ""high-employability"" individuals, suggesting that the UK labor market is sufficiently mobile to ensure a rapid allocation of workers into their ""natural"" sector. Fourth, we find some evidence of job queuing for public sector jobs among ""low-employability"" workers""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The effect of joint and several liability under superfund on brownfields,Economic theory,"""In response to claims that the threat of Superfund liability deters the acquisition of potentially contaminated sites or ""brownfields"" for redevelopment, the federal government and the states have enacted laws or adopted programs to protect purchasers from liability.  This protection may be unwarranted, however, if sellers can simply adjust the price of contaminated property downward to compensate buyers for the liabilities associated with the property.  We present a formal model of joint and several liability under Superfund that allows us to distinguish four different reasons that Superfund liability may discourage the purchase of contaminated property despite the tendency for land prices to reflect the expected transfer of liability to the buyer.  The previous literature has overlooked the four effects that we identify, which all arise because a sale may increase the number of defendants in a suit to recover cleanup costs.  First, a sale may increase the share of liability that a seller and a buyer may expect to pay as a group.  Second, a sale may increase the amount of damages that the government can expect to recover from the defendants at trial.  Third, a sale may increase the total litigation costs that a buyer and a seller may face as a group.  Fourth, game theory suggests that a sale may increase the amount that the government can expect to extract from defendants in a settlement""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Labor income dynamics at business-cycle frequencies implications for portfolio choice /,Economic theory,"""A large recent literature has focused on multiperiod portfolio choice with labor income, and while the models are elaborate along several dimensions, they all assume that the joint distribution of shocks to labor income and asset returns is i.i.d..  Calibrating this joint distribution to U.S.  data, these papers obtain three results not found empirically for U.S.  households: young agents choose a higher stock allocation than old agents; young agents choose a higher stock allocation when poor than when rich; and, young agents always hold some stock.  This paper asks whether allowing the conditional joint distribution to depend on the business cycle can allow the model to generate equity holdings that better match those of U.S.  households, while keeping the unconditional distribution the same as in the data.  Calibrating the business-cycle variation in the first two moments of labor income growth to U.S.  data leads to large reductions in stock holdings by young agents with low wealth-income ratios.  The reductions are so large that young, poor agents now hold less stock than both young, rich agents and old agents, and also hold no stock a large fraction of the time.  Our results suggest that the predictability of labor-income growth at a business-cycle frequency plays an important role in a young agent's decision-making about her portfolio's stock holding""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Why should we care about child labor? the education, labor market, and health consequences of child labor /",Economic theory,"""Although there is an extensive literature on the determinants of child labor and many initiatives aimed at combating it, there is limited evidence on the consequences of child labor on socio-economic outcomes such as education, wages, and health.  We evaluate the causal effect of child labor participation on these outcomes using panel data from Vietnam and an instrumental variables strategy.  Five years subsequent to the child labor experience, we find significant negative impacts on school participation and educational attainment, but also find substantially higher earnings for those (young) adults who worked as children.  We find no significant effects on health.  Over a longer horizon, we estimate that from age 30 onward the forgone earnings attributable to lost schooling exceed any earnings gain associated with child labor and that the net present discounted value of child labor is positive for discount rates of 11.5 percent or higher.  We show that child labor is prevalent among households likely to have higher borrowing costs, that are farther from schools, and whose adult members experienced negative returns to their own education.  This evidence suggests that reducing child labor will require facilitating access to credit and will also require households to be forward looking""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Nominal wage rigidities in Mexico evidence from social security records /,Economic theory,"""This paper analyses the existence and extent of downward nominal wage rigidities in the Mexican labor market using data from the administrative records of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS).  This longitudinal, firm-level dataset allows us to track workers employed with the same firm, observe their wage profiles and calculate the nominal-wage changes they experience over time.  Based on the estimated density functions of nominal wage changes and other moments of the distribution, we are able to calculate several standard tests of nominal wage rigidity that have been proposed in the literature.  Furthermore, we extend these tests to take into account the presence of minimum wage laws that may affect the distribution of nominal wage changes.  The densities and tests calculated using these date are similar to those obtained using administrative data from other countries, and constitute a significant improvement over the measures of nominal wage rigidities obtained from household survey data.  We find considerably more wage rigidity than previous estimates obtained for Mexico using data from the National Urban Employment Survey suggest.  Furthermore, we find evidence that the extent of nominal wage rigidities has been falling over time.  We also document the importance of minimum wages in the Mexican labor market, as evidenced by the large fraction of minimum wage earners and the widespread indexation of wage changes to the minimum wage increases""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Pay or pray? the impact of charitable subsidies on religious attendance /,Economic theory,"""The economic argument for subsidizing charitable giving relies on the positive externalities of charitable activities, particularly from the religious institutions that are the largest recipients of giving.  But the net external effects of subsidies to religious giving will also depend on a potentially important indirect effect as well: impacts on religious participation.  Religious participation can be either a complement to, or a substitute with, the level of charitable giving.  Understanding these spillover effects of charitable giving may be quite important, given the existing observational literature that suggests that religiosity is a major determinant of well-being among Americans.  In this paper I investigate the impact of charitable subsidies on a measure of religious participation, attendance at religious services.  I do so by using data over three decades from the General Social Survey, as well as confirming the impact of such subsidies on religious giving using the Consumer Expenditure Survey.  I find strong evidence that religious giving and religious attendance are substitutes: larger subsidies to charitable giving lead to more religious giving, but less religious attendance, with an implied elasticity of attendance with respect to religious giving of -0.92.  These results have important implications for the debate over charitable subsidies.  They also serve to validate economic models of religious participation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Port efficiency, maritime transport costs and bilateral trade",Economic theory,"""Recent literature has emphasized the importance of transport costs and infrastructure in explaining trade, access to markets, and increases in per capita income.  For most Latin American countries, transport costs are a greater barrier to U.S.  markets than import tariffs.  We investigate the determinants of shipping costs to the U.S.  with a large database of more than 300,000 observations per year on shipments of products aggregated at six-digit HS level from different ports around the world.  Distance volumes and product characteristics matter.  In addition, we find that ports efficiency is an important determinant of shipping costs.  Improving port efficiency from the 25th to the 75th percentile reduces shipping costs by 12 percent.  (Bad ports are equivalent to being 60% farther away from markets for the average country.) Inefficient ports also increase handling costs, which are one of the components of shipping costs.  Reductions in country inefficiencies associated to transport costs from the 25th to 75th percentiles imply an increase in bilateral trade of around 25 percent.  Finally, we try to explain variations in port efficiency and find that they are linked to excessive regulation, the prevalence of organized crime, and the general condition of the country's infrastructure""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Agency problems and risk taking at banks,Economic theory,"""The moral hazard problem associated with deposit insurance generates the potential for excessive risk taking on the part of bank owners.  The banking literature identifies franchise value--a firm's profit-generating potential--as one force mitigating that risk taking.  We argue that in the presence of owner/manager agency problems, managerial risk aversion may also offset the excessive risk taking that stems from moral hazard.  Empirical models of bank risk tend to focus either on the disciplinary role of franchise value or on owner/manager agency problems.  We estimate a unified model and find that both franchise value and ownership structure affect risk at banks.  More important, we identify an interesting interaction effect: The relationship between ownership structure and risk is significant only at low franchise value banks--those where moral hazard problems are most severe and where conflicts between owner and manager risk preferences are therefore strongest.  Risk is lower at banks with no insider holdings, but among other banks, there is no relationship between the level of insider holdings and risk.  This suggests that the owner/manager agency problem affects the choice of risk for only a small number of banks--those with low franchise value and no insider holdings.  Most of these banks increase their insider holdings within a year, and these changes in ownership structure are associated with increased risk.  This suggests that owner/manager agency problems are quickly addressed""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Optimal simple and implementable monetary and fiscal rules,Economic theory,"""The goal of this paper is to compute optimal monetary and fiscal policy rules in a real business cycle model augmented with sticky prices, a demand for money, taxation, and stochastic government consumption.  We consider simple policy rules whereby the nominal interest rate is set as a function of output and inflation, and taxes are set as a function of total government liabilities.  We require policy to be implementable in the sense that it guarantees uniqueness of equilibrium.  We do away with a number of empirically unrealistic assumptions typically maintained in the related literature that are used to justify the computation of welfare using linear methods.  Instead, we implement a second-order accurate solution to the model.  Our main findings are: First, the size of the inflation coefficient in the interest-rate rule plays a minor role for welfare.  It matters only insofar as it affects the determinacy of equilibrium.  Second, optimal monetary policy features a muted response to output.  More importantly, interest rate rules that feature a positive response of the nominal interest rate to output can lead to significant welfare losses.  Third, the optimal fiscal policy is passive.  However, the welfare losses associated with the adoption of an active fiscal stance are negligible""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Stock implied volatility, stock turnover, and the stock-bond return relation",Economic theory,"""The authors study time-variation in the co-movements between daily stock and Treasury bond returns over 1986 to 2000.  Their innovation is to examine whether variation in stock-bond return dynamics can be linked to non-return-based measures of stock market uncertainty, specifically the implied volatility (IV) from equity index options and detrended stock turnover (DTVR).  The authors investigate two empirical questions suggested by recent literature on stock market uncertainty and cross-market hedging.  First, from a forward-looking perspective, they find that the levels of IV and DTVR are both negatively associated with the future correlation between stock and bond returns.  The probability of a negative correlation between daily stock and bond returns over the next month is several times greater following relatively high values of IV and DTVR.  Second, from a contemporaneous perspective, the authors find that bond returns tend to be relatively high (low) during days when IV increases (decreases) and during days when stock turnover is unexpectedly high (low).  Their findings suggest that stock market uncertainty has cross-market pricing influences that play an important role in understanding joint stock-bond price formation.  Further, our results imply that stock-bond diversification benefits increase with stock market uncertainty.  JEL classification: G11, G12, G14""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Normative evaluation of tax policies from households to individuals /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In this paper, we analyze the impact of a tax policy change on social welfare by using jointly a collective model of household labor supply and a microsimulation program of the French tax-benefit system. The collective approach allows studying the intrahousehold distribution so that for the first time, social welfare can be characterized using individual utilities rather than an ambiguous concept of household welfare. This way, the planner's preferences address not only inter-household inequalities but also intra-household inequalities often neglected in the literature. The other contribution of the paper derives from a larger interpretation of labor supply behaviors which represent more than the simple work duration and incorporate unobserved dimensions related to effort or intensity at work. We simulate an extended version of the British Working Family Tax Credit on married couples in France. Two types of conclusions emerge. First, the reform is not desirable for low values (utilitarian) or high values (rawlsian) of the social inequality aversion but rather for an intermediary range. In effect, on the efficiency side, the reform induces strong disincentive effects on the participation of second-earners while on the equity side, it does not specifically target the poorest households. Second, we show that the choice of unit -- household or individual -- strongly condition the results of the normative analysis when departing in a reasonable way from the assumption of equal sharing within the household""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Rural windfall or a new resource curse? coca, income, and civil conflict in Colombia /",Economic theory,"""Natural and agricultural resources for which there is a substantial black market, such as coca, opium, and diamonds, appear especially likely to be exploited by the parties to a civil conflict.  On the other hand, these resources may also provide one of the few reliable sources of income in the countryside.  In this paper, we study the economic and social consequences of a major shift in the production of coca paste from Peru and Bolivia to Colombia, where most coca leaf is now harvested.  This shift, which arose in response to the disruption of the ""air bridge"" that previously ferried coca paste into Colombia, provided an exogenous boost in the demand for Colombian coca leaf.  Our analysis shows this shift generated economic gains in rural areas, primarily in the form of increased self-employment earnings and increased labor supply by teenage boys.  There is little evidence of widespread economic spillovers, however.  The results also suggest that the rural areas which saw accelerated coca production subsequently became much more violent.  Taken together, these findings support the view that the Colombian civil conflict is fueled by the financial opportunities that coca provides.  This is in line with a recent literature which attributes the extension of civil conflicts to economic rewards and an environment that favors insurgency more than to the persistence of economic or political grievances""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
A pair-wise approach to testing for output and growth convergence,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper proposes a pair-wise approach to testing for output convergence that considers all N(N-1)/2 possible pairs of log per capita output gaps across N economies. A general probabilistic definition of output convergence is also proposed, which suggests that all such output gap pairs must be stationary with a constant mean. The approach is compatible with individual output series having unit roots, does not involve the choice of a reference country in computation of output gaps, and can be applied when N is large relative to T (the time dimension of the panel). The proposed test is applied to output series in the Penn World Tables over 1950-2000, as well as to Maddion's historical series over 1870-2000. Overall, the results do not support output convergence, and suggest that the findings of convergence clubs in the literature might be spurious. However, significant evidence of growth convergence is found, a result which is reasonably robust to the choice of the sample period and country groupings. Non-convergence of log per capita outputs combined with growth convergence suggests that while common technological progress seems to have been diffusing reasonably widely across economies, there are nevertheless important countryspecific factors (for example, wars, famines, revolutions, regime and institutional changes) that render output gaps highly persistent, such that we can not be sure that the probability for the outputs gaps to lie within a fixed range will be non-zero""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Bargaining power in marriage earnings, wage rates, and household production /",Economic theory,"""What determines bargaining power in marriage? This paper argues that wage rates, not earnings, determine well-being at the threat point and, hence, determine bargaining power.  Observed earnings at the bargaining equilibrium may differ from earnings at the threat point because hours allocated to market work at the bargaining solution may differ from hours allocated to market work at the threat point.  In the divorce threat model, for example, a wife who does not work for pay while married might do so following a divorce; hence, her bargaining power would be related to her wage rate, not to her earnings while married.  More generally, a spouse whose earnings are high because he or she chooses to allocate more hours to market work, and correspondingly less to household production and leisure, does not have more bargaining power.  But a spouse whose earnings are high because of a high wage rate does have more bargaining power.  Household production has received little attention in the family bargaining literature.  The output of household production is analogous to earnings, and a spouse's productivity in household production is analogous to his or her wage rate.  Thus, in a bargaining model with household production, a spouse's productivity in home production is a source of bargaining power""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The evolution of concentrated ownership in India broad patterns and a history of the Indian software industry /,Economic theory,"""As in many countries (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Sweden), concentrated ownership is a ubiquitous feature of the Indian private sector over the past seven decades.  Yet, unlike in most countries, the identity of the primary families responsible for the concentrated ownership changes dramatically over time, perhaps even more than it does in the U.S.  during the same time period.  It does not appear that concentrated ownership in India is entirely associated with the ills that the literature has recently ascribed to concentrated ownership in emerging markets.  If the concentrated owners are not exclusively, or even primarily, engaged in rent-seeking and entry-deterring behavior, concentrated ownership may not be inimical to competition.  Indeed, as a response to competition, we argue that at least some Indian families the concentrated owners in question have consistently tried to use their business group structures to launch new ventures.  In the process they have either failed hence the turnover in identity or reinvented themselves.  Thus concentrated ownership is a result, rather than a cause, of inefficiencies in capital markets.  Even in the low capital-intensity, relatively unregulated setting of the Indian software industry, we find that concentrated ownership persists in a privately successful and socially useful way.  Since this setting is the least hospitable to the existence of concentrated ownership, we interpret our findings as a lower bound on the persistence of concentrated ownership in the economy at large""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The purchasing power parity debate,Economic theory,"""Originally propounded by the sixteenth-century scholars of the University of Salamanca, the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP) was revived in the interwar period in the context of the debate concerning the appropriate level at which to re-establish international exchange rate parities.  Broadly accepted as a long-run equilibrium condition in the post-war period, it was first advocated as a short-run equilibrium by many international economists in the first few years following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s and then increasingly came under attack on both theoretical and empirical grounds from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s.  Accordingly, over the last three decades, a large literature has built up that examines how much the data deviated from theory, and the fruits of this research have provided a deeper understanding of how well PPP applies in both the short run and the long run.  Since the mid 1990s, larger datasets and nonlinear econometric methods, in particular, have improved estimation.  As deviations narrowed between real exchange rates and PPP, so did the gap narrow between theory and data, and some degree of confidence in long-run PPP began to emerge again.  In this respect, the idea of long-run PPP now enjoys perhaps its strongest support in more than thirty years, a distinct reversion in economic thought""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Robust aggregate implications of stochastic discount factor volatility,Economic theory,"""The stochastic discount factor seems volatile, but is this observation of any consequence for aggregate analysis of consumption, capital accumulation, output, etc.? I amend the standard frictionless model of aggregate consumption and capital accumulation with time-varying subjective probability adjustments, and obtain four implications for aggregate economic analysis.  First, subjective probability adjustments add volatility to the stochastic discount factor, and can rationalize any pattern of asset prices satisfying no-arbitrage, even while capital accumulation is efficient.  Second, despite its flexibility in pricing assets, the model implies that, in expected value, the intertemporal marginal rate of transformation is equal to the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution, and there is a simple, stable, and familiar relation between consumption growth and capital's return.  Third, the expected returns on assets in small net aggregate supply are weakly (and sometimes negatively) correlated with capital's expected return, and are thereby poor predictors of aggregate consumption growth.  Fourth, when it comes to assets in small net aggregate supply, capital gains reflect time varying risk premia, and returns can predict aggregate consumption growth better when the capital gain component of those returns is ignored.  All four implications are consistent with empirical results reported here, and in the previous literature documenting stochastic discount factor volatility.  Several recent theories of stochastic discount factor volatility can, from the aggregate point of view, be interpreted as special cases of subjective probability adjusted CCAPM""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The cost of US pharmaceutical price reduction a financial simulation model of R & D /,Economic theory,"""Previous empirical studies that have examined the links between pharmaceutical price controls, profits, cash flows, and investment in research and development (R&D) have been largely based on retrospective statistical analyses of firm- and/or industry-level data.  These studies, which have contributed numerous insights and findings to the literature, relied upon ad hoc reduced-form model specifications.  In the current paper we take a very different approach: a prospective micro-simulation approach.  Using Monte Carlo techniques we model how future price controls in the U.S.  will impact early-stage product development decisions in the pharmaceutical industry.  This is done within the context of a net present value (NPV) framework that appropriately reflects the uncertainty associated with R&D project technical success, development costs, and future revenues.  Using partial-information estimators calibrated with the most contemporary clinical and economic data available, we demonstrate how pharmaceutical price controls will significantly diminish the incentives to undertake early-stage R&D investment.  For example, we estimate that cutting prices by 40 to 50 percent in the U.S.  will lead to between 30 to 60 percent fewer R&D projects being undertaken (in early-stage development).  Given the recent legislative efforts to control prescription drug prices in the U.S., and the likelihood that price controls will prevail as a result, it is important to better understand the firm response to such a regulatory change""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Testing the significance of calendar effects,Economic theory,"""This paper studies tests of calendar effects in equity returns.  It is necessary to control for all possible calendar effects to avoid spurious results.  The authors contribute to the calendar effects literature and its significance with a test for calendar-specific anomalies that conditions on the nuisance of possible calendar effects.  Thus, their approach to test for calendar effects produces robust data-mining results.  Unfortunately, attempts to control for a large number of possible calendar effects have the downside of diminishing the power of the test, making it more difficult to detect actual anomalies.  The authors show that our test achieves good power properties because it exploits the correlation structure of (excess) returns specific to the calendar effect being studied.  We implement the test with bootstrap methods and apply it to stock indices from Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Bootstrap p-values reveal that calendar effects are significant for returns in most of these equity markets, but end-of-the-year effects are predominant.  It also appears that, beginning in the late 1980s, calendar effects have diminished except in small-cap stock indices""--Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta web site."
Slow passthrough around the world a new import for developing countries? /,Economic theory,"""Developing countries traditionally exhibit passthrough of exchange rate changes that is greater and more rapid than high-income countries, but have experienced a rapid downward trend in recent years in the degree of short-run passthrough, and in the adjustment speed.  As a consequence, slow and incomplete passthrough is no longer exclusively a luxury of industrial countries.  Using a new data set--prices of eight narrowly defined brand commodities, observed in 76 countries --we find empirical support for some of the factors that have been hypothesized in the literature, but not for others.  Significant determinants of the passthrough coefficient include per capita incomes, bilateral distance, tariffs, country size, wages, long-term inflation, and long-term exchange rate variability.  Some of these factors changed during the 1990s.  Part (and only part) of the downward trend in passthrough to imported goods prices, and in turn to competitors' prices and the CPI, can be explained by changes in the monetary environment.  Real wages also work to reduce passthrough to competitors' prices and the CPI, confirming the hypothesized role of distribution and retail costs in pricing to market.  Rising distribution costs, due perhaps to the Balassa-Samuelson-Baumol effect, could contribute to the decline in the passthrough coefficient in some developing countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Tax structure in developing countries many puzzles and a possible explanation /,Economic theory,"""Tax policies seen in developing countries are puzzling on many dimensions.  To begin with, revenue/GDP is surprisingly small compared with that in developed economies.  Taxes on labor income play a minor role.  Taxes on consumption are important, but effective tax rates vary dramatically by firm, with many firms avoiding taxes entirely by operating through cash in the informal economy and others facing very high liabilities.  Taxes on capital are an important source of revenue, as are tariffs and seignorage, all contrary to the theoretical literature.In this paper, we argue that all of these aspects of policy may be sensible responses if a government is able in practice to collect taxes only from those firms that make use of the financial sector.  Through use of the financial sector, firms generate a paper trail, facilitating tax enforcement.  The threat of disintermediation then limits how much can be collected in taxes.  Taxes can most easily be collected from the firms most dependent on the financial sector, presumably capital-intensive firms.  Given the resulting differential tax rates by sector, other policies would sensibly be used to offset these tax distortions.  Tariff protection for capital-intensive firms is one.  Inflation, imposing a tax on the cash economy is another""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Families, human capital, and small business evidence from the characteristics of business owners survey /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""An important finding in the rapidly growing literature on self-employment is that the probability of self-employment is substantially higher among the children of business owners than among the children of non-business owners. Using data from the confidential and restricted-access Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) Survey, we provide some suggestive evidence on the causes of intergenerational links in business ownership and the related issue of how having a family business background affects small business outcomes. Estimates from the CBO indicate that more than half of all business owners had a self-employed family member prior to starting their business. Conditional on having a self-employed family member, less than 50 percent of small business owners worked in that family member's business suggesting that it is unlikely that intergenerational links in self-employment are solely due to the acquisition of general and specific business capital and that instead similarities across family members in entrepreneurial preferences may explain part of the relationship. In contrast, estimates from regression models conditioning on business ownership indicate that having a self-employed family member plays only a minor role in determining small business outcomes, whereas the business human capital acquired from prior work experience in a family member's business appears to be very important for business success. Estimates from the CBO also indicate that only 1.6 percent of all small businesses are inherited suggesting that the role of business inheritances in determining intergenerational links in self-employment is limited at best""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Lucky stores, gambling, and addiction empirical evidence from state lottery sales /",Economic theory,"""There is a large body of literature in both psychology and economics documenting mistaken perceptions of randomness.  In this paper we demonstrate that people appear to believe that ""lightning will strike twice"" when it comes to lottery jackpots.  First, we show that in the week following the sale of a winning ticket, retailers that sell a winning jackpot ticket experience relative increases in game-specific ticket sales of between 12 and 38 percent, with the sales response increasing in the size of the jackpot.  In addition, the increase in sales experienced by the winning vendor increases with the proportion of the local population comprised of high school dropouts, elderly adults, and households receiving public assistance.  We further show that this increase in retail-game sales initially reflects an increase in total sales at the retail and zip code level.  Second, we show that the increase in sales is persistent at the winning retailer.  However, the data no not provide clear evidence that the increase in sales at the zip code level is persistent.  It thus appears that in the long run, consumers are persistent in their habit of buying lottery tickets at the ""lucky"" store; however, as the shock to total gambling dissipates, there is no evidence that lottery gambling itself is habit forming or addictive""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Assigning deviant youths to minimize total harm,Economic theory,"""A common practice in the fields of education, mental health, and juvenile justice is to segregate problem youths in groups with deviant peers.  Assignments of this sort, which concentrate deviant youths, may facilitate deviant peer influence and lead to perverse outcomes.  This possibility adds to the list of arguments in support of ""mainstreaming"" whenever possible.  But there are other concerns that help justify segregated-group assignments, including efficiency of service delivery and protection of the public.  Our analysis organizes the discussion about the relevant tradeoffs.  First, the number of deviant youths (relative to the size of the relevant population, or to the number of assignment locations) affects whether the harm-minimizing assignment calls for diffusion or segregation.  Second, the nature of the problematic behavior is relevant; behavior which has a direct, detrimental effect on others who share the assignment makes a stronger case for segregation.  Third, the capacity for behavior control matters, and may make the difference in a choice between segregation and integration.  We briefly discuss the empirical literature, which with some exceptions is inadequate to the task of providing clear guidance about harm-minimizing assignment strategies.  Finally, we reflect briefly on the medical-practice principle ""first do no harm,"" and contrast it with the claims of potential victims of deviants""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Deflationary bubbles,Economic theory,"""We analyse deflationary bubbles in a model where money is the only financial asset.  We show that such bubbles are consistent with the household's transversality condition if and only if the nominal money stock is falling.  Our results are in sharp contrast to those in several prominent contributions to the literature, where deflationary bubbles are ruled out by appealing to a non-standard transversality condition, originally due to Brock.  This condition, which we dub the GABOR condition, states that the consumer must be indifferent between reducing his money holdings by one unit and leaving them unchanged and enjoying the discounted present value of the marginal utility of that unit of money forever.  We show that the GABOR condition is not part of the necessary and sufficient conditions for household optimality nor is it sufficient to rule out deflationary bubbles.  Moreover, it rules out Friedman's optimal quantity of money equilibrium and, when the nominal money stock is falling, it rules out deflationary bubbles that are consistent with household optimality.  We also consider economies with real and nominal government debt and small open economies where private agents can lend to and borrow from abroad.  In these cases, deflationary bubbles may be possible, even when the nominal money stock is rising.  Their existence is shown to depend on the rules governing the issuance of government debt""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Unlocking housing equity in Japan,Economic theory,"""Prior literature on asset patterns among the elderly often overlooks housing wealth as a determinant of retiree wealth, particularly in the Japanese context.  Yet releasing equity in housing may be a natural mechanism to boost consumption, reduce public pension liability, and mitigate the demand for long-term care facilities in Japan.  Our study evaluates what might be needed to implement reverse mortgages (RMs) in this country.  Policies could include exempting RMs from capital gains tax and transactions tax, along with mechanisms to make annuity income flows nontaxable, along with interest rate accruals for RMs.  In addition, housing market reforms to enhance information flows would be needed, particularly regarding new and existing housing trades, which could permit the securitization of housing loans and lines of credit.  Other improvements in capital markets could also help, including the establishment of reinsurance mechanisms to help lenders offer these reverse mortgages while having some protection against crossover risk.  In the Japanese case, demand for RMs will be dampened by declining residential housing values as well as low interest rates and long life expectancies.  Nevertheless, we conclude that RMs might be a good way to finance elderly consumption in Japan, particularly against the backdrop of governmental financial stringencies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Fertility and its consequence on family labour supply,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""While a large body of literature focuses on how fertility affects female labour market participation, there are relatively few studies that examine the effect of fertility on male labour market participation. Even if the burden of child care falls mainly on women, an exogenous increase in fertility is likely to change the optimal allocation of time, therefore, the labour supply decision of both female and male in a household. This paper analyses how an exogenous increase in fertility affects labour market participation of men and women in Indonesia -- a country that has seen dramatic changes in the labour market over recent decades. The finding is that women reduce their working hours in response to the higher fecundity in both rural and urban areas in Indonesia. On the other hand, the higher fecundity leads to men's increasing their working hours only in rural areas. The higher degree of specialization in response to fertility in rural areas is driven mainly by the differences in the cost of childcare rather than the characteristics of occupation or household bargaining power""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Spill-overs from good jobs,Economic theory,"""Does attracting or losing jobs in high paying sectors have important spill-over effects on wages in other sectors? The answer to this question is central to a proper assessment of many trade and industrial policies.  In this paper, we explore this question by examining how predictable changes in industrial composition in favor of high paying sectors affect wage determination at the industry-city level.  In particular, we use US Census data over the years 1970 to 2000 to quantify the relationship between changes in industry-specific city-level wages and changes in industrial composition.  Our finding is that the spill-over (i.e., general equilibrium) effects associated with changes in the fraction of jobs in high paying sectors are very substantial and persistent.  Our point estimates indicate that the total effect on average wages of a change in industrial composition that favors high paying sectors is about 3.5 times greater than that obtained from a commonly used composition-adjustment approach which neglects general equilibrium effects.  We interpret our results as being most likely driven by a variant of the mechanism recently emphasized in the heterogenous firm literature whereby changes in competitive pressure cause a reallocation of employment toward the most efficient firms""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Too young to leave the nest the effects of school starting age /,Economic theory,"""Does it matter when a child starts school? While the popular press seems to suggest it does, there is limited evidence of a long-run effect of school starting age on student outcomes.  This paper uses data on the population of Norway to examine the role of school starting age on longer-run outcomes such as IQ scores at age 18, educational attainment, teenage pregnancy, and earnings.  Unlike much of the recent literature, we are able to separate school starting age from test age effects using scores from IQ tests taken outside of school, at the time of military enrolment, and measured when students are around age 18.  Importantly, there is variation in the mapping between year and month of birth and the year the test is taken, allowing us to distinguish the effects of school starting age from pure age effects.  We find evidence for a small positive effect of starting school younger on IQ scores measured at age 18.  In contrast, we find evidence of much larger positive effects of age at test, and these results are very robust.  We also find that starting school younger has a significant positive effect on the probability of teenage pregnancy, but has little effect on educational attainment of boys or girls.  There appears to be a short-run positive effect on earnings of beginning school at a younger age; however, this effect has essentially disappeared by age 30.  This pattern is consistent with the idea that starting school later reduces potential labor market experience at a given age for a given level of education; however, this becomes less important as individuals age""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Bayesian learning in social networks,Economic theory,"""We study the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of a model of learning over a general social network.  Each individual receives a signal about the underlying state of the world, observes the past actions of a stochastically-generated neighborhood of individuals, and chooses one of two possible actions.  The stochastic process generating the neighborhoods defines the network topology (social network).  The special case where each individual observes all past actions has been widely studied in the literature.  We characterize pure-strategy equilibria for arbitrary stochastic and deterministic social networks and characterize the conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning -- that is, the conditions under which, as the social network becomes large, individuals converge (in probability) to taking the right action.  We show that when private beliefs are unbounded (meaning that the implied likelihood ratios are unbounded), there will be asymptotic learning as long as there is some minimal amount of ""expansion in observations"".  Our main theorem shows that when the probability that each individual observes some other individual from the recent past converges to one as the social network becomes large, unbounded private beliefs are sufficient to ensure asymptotic learning.  This theorem therefore establishes that, with unbounded private beliefs, there will be asymptotic learning an almost all reasonable social networks.  We also show that for most network topologies, when private beliefs are bounded, there will not be asymptotic learning.  In addition, in contrast to the special case where all past actions are observed, asymptotic learning is possible even with bounded beliefs in certain stochastic network topologies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Use of propensity scores in non-linear response models the case for health care expenditures /,Economic theory,"""Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, a large literature exists on methods that can be used to estimating average treatment effects (ATE) from observational data and that spans regression models, propensity score adjustments using stratification, weighting or regression and even the combination of both as in doubly-robust estimators.  However, comparison of these alternative methods is sparse in the context of data generated via non-linear models where treatment effects are heterogeneous, such as is in the case of healthcare cost data.  In this paper, we compare the performance of alternative regression and propensity score-based estimators in estimating average treatment effects on outcomes that are generated via non-linear models.  Using simulations, we find that in moderate size samples (n= 5000), balancing on estimated propensity scores balances the covariate means across treatment arms but fails to balance higher-order moments and covariances amongst covariates, raising concern about its use in non-linear outcomes generating mechanisms.  We also find that besides inverse-probability weighting (IPW) with propensity scores, no one estimator is consistent under all data generating mechanisms.  The IPW estimator is itself prone to inconsistency due to misspecification of the model for estimating propensity scores.  Even when it is consistent, the IPW estimator is usually extremely inefficient.  Thus care should be taken before naively applying any one estimator to estimate ATE in these data.  We develop a recommendation for an algorithm which may help applied researchers to arrive at the optimal estimator.  We illustrate the application of this algorithm and also the performance of alternative methods in a cost dataset on breast cancer treatment""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Immigration and national wages clarifying the theory and the empirics /,Economic theory,"""This paper estimates the effects of immigration on wages of native workers at the national U.S.  level.  Following Borjas (2003) we focus on national labor markets for workers of different skills and we enrich his methodology and refine previous estimates.  We emphasize that a production function framework is needed to combine workers of different skills in order to evaluate the competition as well as cross-skill complementary effects of immigrants on wages.  We also emphasize the importance (and estimate the value) of the elasticity of substitution between workers with at most a high school degree and those without one.  Since the two groups turn out to be close substitutes, this strongly dilutes the effects of competition between immigrants and workers with no degree.  We then estimate the substitutability between natives and immigrants and we find a small but significant degree of imperfect substitution which further decreases the competitive effect of immigrants.  Finally, we account for the short run and long run adjustment of capital in response to immigration.  Using our estimates and Census data we find that immigration (1990-2006) had small negative effects in the short run on native workers with no high school degree (-0.7%) and on average wages (-0.4%) while it had small positive effects on native workers with no high school degree (+0.3%) and on average native wages (+0.6%) in the long run.  These results are perfectly in line with the estimated aggregate elasticities in the labor literature since Katz and Murphy (1992).  We also find a wage effect of new immigrants on previous immigrants in the order of negative 6%""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The higher educational transformation of china and its global implications,Economic theory,"""This paper documents the major transformation of higher education that has been underway in China since 1999 and evaluates its potential global impacts.  Reflecting China's commitment to continued high growth through quality upgrading and the production of ideas and intellectual property as set out in both the 10th (2001-2005) and 11th (2006-2010) five-year plans, this transformation focuses on major new resource commitments to tertiary education and also embodies significant changes in organizational form.  This focus on tertiary education differentiates the Chinese case from other countries who earlier at similar stages of development instead stressed primary and secondary education.  The number of undergraduate and graduate students in China has been grown at approximately 30% per year since 1999, and the number of graduates at all levels of higher education in China has approximately quadrupled in the last 6 years.  The size of entering classes of new students and total student enrollments have risen even faster, and have approximately quintupled.  Prior to 1999 increases in these areas were much smaller.  Much of the increased spending is focused on elite universities, and new academic contracts differ sharply from earlier ones with no tenure and annual publication quotas often used.  All of these changes have already had large impacts on China's higher educational system and are beginning to be felt by the wider global educational structure.  We suggest that even more major impacts will follow in the years to come and there are implications for global trade both directly in ideas, and in idea derived products.  These changes, for now, seem relatively poorly documented in literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Religion, terrorism and public goods testing the club model /",Economic theory,"""Can rational choice modeling explain why Hamas, Taliban, Hezbollah and other radical religious rebels are so lethal? The literature rejects theological explanations.  We propose a club framework, which emphasizes the function of voluntary religious organizations as efficient providers of local public goods in the absence of government provision.  The sacrifices religious clubs require are economically efficient (Iannaccone (1992)), making them well suited for solving the extreme principal-agent problems faced by terrorist and insurgent organizations.  Thus religious clubs can be potent terrorists.  That explanation is supported by data on terrorist lethality in the Middle East.  The same approach explains why religious clubs often choose suicide attacks.  Using three data sources spanning a half century, and comparing suicide attackers to civil war insurgents, we show that suicide attacks are chosen when targets are ""hard,"" i.e., difficult to destroy.  Data from Israel/Palestine confirm that prediction.  To explain why radical religious clubs specialize in suicide attacks we model the choice of tactics by rebels attacking hard targets, considering the human costs and tactical benefits of suicide attacks.  We ask what a suicide attacker would have to believe to be rational.  We then embed that attacker and other operatives in a club model.  The model has testable implications for tactic choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebels, which are supported by data on terrorist attacks in the Middle East: Radical religious clubs are more lethal and choose suicide terrorism more often, when they provide benign local public goods.  Our results suggest benign tactics to counter terrorism by religious radicals""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The impact of athletic performance on alumni giving an analysis of micro data /,Economic theory,"""An ongoing controversy in the literature on the economics of higher education centers on whether the success of a school's athletic program affects alumni donations.  This paper uses a unique data set to investigate this issue.  The data contain detailed information about donations made by alumni of a selective research university as well as a variety of their economic and de-mographic characteristics.  One important question is how to characterize the success of an athletic program.  We focus not only on the performance of the most visible teams, football and basketball, but also on the success of the team on which he or she played as an undergraduate.  One of our key findings is that the impact of athletic success on donations differs for men and women.  When a male graduate's former team wins its conference championship, his donations for general purposes increase by about 7 percent and his donations to the athletic program increase by about the same percentage.  Football and basketball records generally have small and statistically insignificant effects; in some specifications, a winning basketball season reduces donations.  For women there is no statistically discernible effect of a former team's success on current giving; as is the case for men, the impacts of football and basketball, while statistically significant in some specifications, are not important in magnitude.  Another novel result is that for males, varsity athletes whose teams were successful when they were undergraduates subsequently make larger donations to the athletic program.  For example, if a male alumnus's team won its conference championship during his senior year, his subsequent giving to the athletic program is about 8 percent a year higher, ceteris paribus""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Beyond signaling and human capital education and the revelation of ability /,Economic theory,"""In traditional signaling models, education provides a way for individuals to sort themselves by ability.  Employers in turn use education to statistically discriminate, paying wages that reflect the average productivity of workers with the same given level of education.  In this paper, we provide evidence that education (specifically, attending college) plays a much more direct role in revealing ability to the labor market.  We use the NLSY79 to examine returns to ability early in careers; our results suggest that ability is observed nearly perfectly for college graduates but is revealed to the labor market much more gradually for high school graduates.  As a result, from very beginning of the career, college graduates are paid in accordance with their own ability, while the wages of high school graduates are initially completely unrelated to their own ability.  This view of ability revelation in the labor market has considerable power in explaining racial differences in wages, education, and the returns to ability.  In particular, we find no racial differences in wages or returns to ability in the college labor market, but a 6-10 percent wage penalty for blacks (conditional on ability) in the high school market.  These results are consistent with the notion that employers use race to statistically discriminate in the high school market but have no need to do so in the college market.  That blacks face a wage penalty in the high school but not the college labor market also helps to explains why, conditional on ability, blacks are more likely to earn a college degree, a fact that has been documented in the literature but for which a full explanation has yet to emerge""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Measuring beginner reading skills an empirical evaluation of alternative instruments and their potential use for policymaking and accountability in peru /,Finance,"""Based on analysis of reading performance data from 475 third-graders in Peru, this study makes recommendations on improving reading tests, choice of reading standards, and how to present the results at the school and individual levels.  The paper reviews the literature on using reading skills measurement in the early grades to guide policymaking, strengthen accountability, and improve education quality.  It uses data generated from the same students using two common approaches to measuring reading skills: an individually-administered oral fluency test, and a group-administered written comprehension test designed by the Ministry of Education for the 2006 universal standard test of second grade reading comprehension.  These two approaches have sometimes been presented as competing alternatives, but the paper shows that it is better if they are used together, as complements.  Based on psychometric analysis, the paper shows that both the oral and written tests adequately measured students' reading abilities.  The results show that reading fluency and comprehension are correlated: fluent readers are more likely to understand what they read than non-fluent readers.  The strength of the fluency-comprehension relationship depends on the level of fluency, the difficulty of the questions, and social characteristics of the school.  The paper recommends using improved versions of both tests to evaluate early grade reading skills, as a central element of a system of accountability for results.  It proposes a model for reporting test results desgned to highlight the importance of reading standards, mobilize the education community to reach them, track progress, and identify students in need of extra support.

Econometric explorations on bounded rationality the case of job changing behavior /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In this paper we question the hypothesis of full rationality in the context of job changing behavior, via simple econometric explorations on microdata drawn from WHIP (Worker Histories Italian Panel). A rational outcome of the job matching process implies a positive tradeoff between future wages and risk-on-the-job. The main result of this paper is that no ""rational"" tradeoff is observable after controlling for a variety of possible shifters. However, if we control for individual characteristics and replace wage growth by its predictor net of individual effects, the picture changes with the emergence of a significantly positive tradeoff between wage growth and risk-on-the-job. The interpretation is suggestive: while market forces (net of individual effects) drive towards a rational outcome, individual characteristics, instead of reinforcing the ""rationality"" of a positive tradeoff, lead towards the opposite direction of confounding good and bad options. Our explanation for these findings is that people act on the basis of bounded rationality  ̉la Simon. If our assessment is correct, the implications are powerful: are there reasons to believe that such patterns are found only in the context of job search and worker mobility and not in other instances of economic behavior? Recent literature on bounded rationality strongly suggests the contrary. Why, then, should economists leave unchallenged and unchallengeable the hypothesis of full rationality? Had our investigation aimed at estimating the elasticities of wage growth and job safety of the workers' utilities, we would have miserably failed. Is this a consequence of a misspecified model or of the wrong behavioral assumptions? Our support unquestionably goes to the latter""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Risk tolerance and alcohol demand among adults and older adults,Economic theory,"""This study has two primary goals.  These are the examination of the effect of risk tolerance on individuals' demand for alcohol and second, the examination of the demand for alcohol by older adults over the age of 55.  The data sets employed are multiple waves from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).  While risk tolerance can impact the level of alcohol consumption, it may also affect the sensitivity of demand to prices.  There are parallels between the economist's and the psychologist's concept of risk tolerance.  Research on attitudes towards risk by psychologists is part of a larger theoretical and empirical literature on personality traits.  Psychologists have found risk tolerance to be an important determinant of alcohol consumption.  The empirical results indicate that risk aversion has a significant negative effect on alcohol consumption, with the prevalence and consumption among risk-tolerant individuals being six to eight percent higher.  Furthermore, the tax elasticity is similar across both risk-averse and risk-tolerant individuals.  This suggests that tax policies may be effective in deterring alcohol consumption even among those who have a higher propensity for alcohol use.  The significance of research on alcohol demand by individuals ages 55 and older is highlighted by the increased potential for alcohol-related adverse consequences among this demographic group.  Comparing younger adults (ages 21-54) with older adults, responses to taxes and prices are higher among the older sub-population.  The tax elasticity is estimated at -0.05 for younger adults, compared to -0.20 for older adults""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The impact of litigation on venture capitalist reputation,Economic theory,"""Venture capital contracts give VCs enormous power over entrepreneurs and early equity investors of portfolio companies.  A large literature examines how these contractual terms protect VCs against misbehavior by entrepreneurs.  But what constrains misbehavior by VCs? We provide the first systematic analysis of legal and non-legal mechanisms that penalize VC misbehavior, even when such misbehavior is formally permitted by contract.  We hand-collect a sample of over 177 lawsuits involving venture capitalists.  The three most common types of VC-related litigation are: 1) lawsuits filed by entrepreneurs, which most often allege freezeout and transfer of control away from founders; 2) lawsuits filed by early equity investors in startup companies; and 3) lawsuits filed by VCs.  Our empirical analysis of the lawsuit data proceeds in two steps.  We first estimate an empirical model of the propensity of VCs to get involved in litigation as a function of VC characteristics.  We match each venture firm that was involved in litigation to otherwise similar venture firm that was not involved in litigation and find that less reputable VCs are more likely to participate in litigation, as are VCs focusing on early-stage investments, and VCs with larger deal flow.  Second, we analyze the relationship between different types of lawsuits and VC fundraising and deal flow.  Although plaintiffs lose most VC-related lawsuits, litigation does not go unnoticed: in subsequent years, the involved VCs raise significantly less capital than their peers and invest in fewer deals.  The biggest losers are VCs who were defendants in a lawsuit, and especially VCs who were alleged to have expropriated founders""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The relation between child labour and mothers' work the case of india /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""The paper deals with child labour in developing countries. We address a problem that has recently drawn much attention at the international level, that is, how to invest in women's rights to advance the rights of both women and children. We study the problem from a new perspective. In our theoretical model we assume that the child's time is an extension of her/his mother's time, and that she has to decide how to allocate it. We estimate two empirical specifications, both multinomial logit. The first one, in line with the standard approach in the literature, estimates a model of the probability of the different child's states, conditional on her/his mother's states. The second empirical specification, in line with our theoretical model, estimates the mother-child states jointly. Using a unique, rich and representative data survey for all Indian states and for urban and rural India (NFHS-2, 1998/9), we select our sample drawing information from the household data set and the women's data set. Our results show that the presence of the mother in the family increases children welfare, in terms of educational opportunities and protection from work activities. All our results indicate that the mother tends to stay home and send her children to school the better is the father's employment position and the wealthier is the family. However, we observe a perverse effect. If the mother works, since female job quality and wage levels are very low, also her children have a higher probability to work""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Currency mismatches, default risk, and exchange rate depreciation evidence from the end of bimetallism /",Economic theory,"""It is generally very difficult to measure the effects of a currency depreciation on a country's balance sheet and financing costs given the endogenous properties of the exchange rate.  History provides at least one natural experiment to test whether an exogenous exchange rate depreciation can be contractionary (via an increased real debt burden) or expansionary (via an improved current account).  France's decision to suspend the free coinage of silver in 1876 played a paramount role in causing a large exogenous depreciation of the nominal exchange rates of all silver standard countries versus gold backed currencies such as the British pound, the currency in which much of their debt was payable.  Our identifying assumption is that France's decision to end bimetallism was exogenous from the viewpoint of countries on the silver standard.  To deal with heterogeneity we implement a difference in differences estimator.  Sovereign yield spreads for countries on the silver standard increased in proportion to the potential currency mismatch.  Yield spreads for silver countries increased ten to fifteen percent in the wake of the depreciation.  Basic growth models suggest that the accompanying reduction in investment could have decreased output per capita by between one and four percent relative to the preshock trajectory.  This also illustrates that a substantial proportion of the decrease in spreads gold standard countries identified in the ""Good Housekeeping"" literature could be attributable to the increase in exchange rate stability.  Finally, if emerging markets are going to embrace international capital flows, the most export oriented countries will manage to mitigate the negative effects of a currency mismatch""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Comparative advantage, demand for external finance, and financial development",Finance,"""The differences in the levels of financial development between industrial and developing countries are large and persistent.  Theoretical and empirical literature has argued that these differences are the source of comparative advantage and could therefore shape trade patterns.  This paper points out the reverse link: financial development is influenced by comparative advantage.  The authors illustrate this idea using a model in which a country's financial development is an equilibrium outcome of the economy's productive structure: financial systems are more developed in countries with large financially intensive sectors.  After trade opening demand for external finance, and therefore financial development, are higher in a country that specializes in financially intensive goods.  By contrast, financial development is lower in countries that primarily export goods which do not rely on external finance.  The authors demonstrate this effect empirically using data on financial development and export patterns in a panel of 96 countries over the period 1970-99.  Using trade data, they construct a summary measure of a country's external finance need of exports and relate it to the level of financial development.  In order to overcome the simultaneity problem, they adopt a strategy in the spirit of Frankel and Romer (1999).  The authors exploit sector-level bilateral trade data to construct, for each country and time period, a predicted value of external finance need of exports based on the estimated effect of geography variables on trade volumes across sectors.  Their results indicate that financial development is an equilibrium outcome that depends strongly on a country's trade pattern. ""--World Bank web site."
Does ethnicity pay?,Economic theory,"""One of the most important and one of the most heavily studied ethnic networks in the world is overseas Chinese.  However, almost all of the analysis on the economic dimensions of the overseas Chinese network has been about the effects of ethnic ties on the aggregate volume of trade or the effects of ethnic ties on foreign direct investment (FDI) at the country level.  In this paper, we add to the large and important collection of literature on the subject by studying the profitability of foreign direct investments made by overseas Chinese in China.  Our paper takes advantage of a large dataset-over 50,000 firms over a period of eight years-that is comprised of two types of foreign firms with investments in China-those owned by ethnic Chinese and those owned by non-ethnic Chinese.  Against common perceptions, we find that ethnically Chinese firms in China do not outperform non-ethnically Chinese firms by a set of conventional profitability measures.  We also find that the performance of ethnically Chinese firms deteriorates over time.  One hypothesis explaining this result is that ethnically Chinese firms tend to under-invest in those firm attributes that may enhance long-term performance, such as human capital and technology (proxied by intangible assets in our paper).  Indeed we do find evidence that ethnically Chinese firms invest far less in intangible assets and human capital as compared with non-ethnically Chinese firms of similar size, age, and other characteristics.  In addition, within strata of matched firms based on their intangible assets and human capital, ethnically Chinese firms no longer display significant dynamic disadvantage relative to non-ethnic firms after controlling for other firm characteristics and fixed effects""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Entry and selection in auctions,Economic theory,"""We develop and estimate an entry model for second price and open outcry independent private value auctions where potential bidders receive an imperfectly informative signal about their value prior to deciding whether to pay a sunk entry cost.  In this way the model flexibly allows for selection on values, which will affect an entrant's subsequent competitiveness, at the entry stage.  As signals become more informative, the entry process exhibits greater selection as firms with higher values are more likely to enter.  We allow for asymmetries across bidders and unobserved heterogeneity across auctions, which are important features of most data sets.  We show how incorrectly assuming the extremes of either no selection (no signal) or perfect selection (prior knowledge of one's value) - the common alternatives in the literature - can yield incorrect estimates of model primitives and bias the results from counterfactuals.  We apply our model to U.S.  Forest Service timber auctions and find strong evidence in favor of a selective entry process.  We take advantage of the flexible entry model to reevaluate the well known theory result that with fixed participation a seller prefers an extra bidder over the ability to set an optimal reserve price.  In our model, the relative value of setting a reserve price and increasing the number of potential entrants to a revenue-maximizing seller will depend on the degree of selection.  Our structural estimates imply that, if the USFS wants to maximize revenues, it will benefit more from adding an additional potential entrant than setting an optimal reserve price""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Rebalancing and the Chinese vat some numerical simulation results /,Economic theory,"""This paper presents numerical simulation results that suggest that China can both reduce its trade imbalance and receive welfare benefits by switching the value added tax (VAT) regime from the current destination principle to an origin principle.  With the tax on exports exceeding that no longer collected on imports, revenues rise and exports fall.  VAT regime switching is thus a possibility for China to receive a double benefit, rebalancing trade with a welfare gain.  This has implications for present G20 discussions on finding ways to adjust global trade imbalances.  Under a destination principle, imports are taxed but input taxes are rebated on exports (as currently).  Under an origin basis imports are not taxed, but no export rebates are given.  Previous VAT literature stresses the neutrality of tax basis switches, which simply reflect moving between consumption and production taxes, but neutrality only holds when trade is balanced.  In the unbalanced trade case for countries with a trade surplus, such as China, an origin basis offers a lower tax rate on an equal yield basis and reduced exports.  We use a two country endogenous trade imbalance general equilibrium global trade model with endogenous factor supply, a fixed exchange rate and a non-accommodative monetary policy structure which supports the Chinese trade imbalance.  We calibrate model parameters to 2008 data and simulate counterfactual equilibria for VAT tax basis switches in which the trade imbalance changes.  Our results suggest that given China's trade surplus VAT regime switching to an origin can decrease China's trade surplus by over 50%, and additionally increase Chinese and world welfare.

The impact of plant-level resource reallocations and technical progress on U.S. macroeconomic growth,Economic theory,"""We build up from the plant level an ""aggregate(d)"" Solow residual by estimating every U.S.  manufacturing plant's contribution to the change in aggregate final demand between 1976 and 1996.  Our framework uses the Petrin and Levinsohn (2010) definition of aggregate productivity growth, which aggregates plant-level changes to changes in aggregate final demand in the presence of imperfect competition and other distortions/frictions.  We decompose these contributions into plant-level resource reallocations and plant-level technical efficiency changes while allowing in the estimation for 459 different production technologies, one for each 4-digit SIC code.  On average we find positive aggregate productivity growth of 2.2% in this sector during this period of declining share in U.S.  GDP.  We find that aggregate reallocation made a larger contribution to growth than aggregate technical efficiency.  Our estimates of the contribution of reallocation range from 1.7% to 2.1% per year, while our estimates of the average contribution of aggregate technical efficiency growth range from 0.2% to 0.6% per year.  In terms of cyclicality, the aggregate technical efficiency component has a standard deviation that is roughly 50% to 100% larger than that of aggregate total reallocation, pointing to an important role for technical efficiency in macroeconomic fluctuations.  Aggregate reallocation is negative in only 3 of the 20 years of our sample, suggesting that the movement of inputs to more highly valued activities on average plays a stabilizing role in manufacturing growth.  Our results have implications for both the theoretical literature on growth and alternative indexes of aggregate productivity growth based only on technical efficiency""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Deficits and debt in the short and long run,Economic theory,"""This paper begins by examining the persistence of movements in the U.S.  Government's budget posture. Deficits display considerable persistence, and debt levels (relative to GDP) even more so. Further, the degree of persistence depends on what gives rise to budget deficits in the first place.  Deficits resulting from shocks to defense spending exhibit the greatest persistence and those from shocks to nondefense spending the least; deficits resulting from shocks to revenues fall in the middle. The paper next reviews recent evidence on the impact of changes in government debt levels (again, relative to GDP) on interest rates. The recent literature, focusing on expected future debt levels and expected real interest rates, indicates impacts that are large in the context of actual movements in debt levels: for example, an increase of 94 basis points due to the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio during 1981-93, and a decline of 65 basis point due to the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio during 1993-2001. The paper next asks why deficits would exhibit the observed negative correlation with key elements of investment.  One answer, following the analysis presented earlier, is that deficits are persistent and therefore lead to changes in expected future debt levels, which in turn affect real interest rates. A different reason, however, revolves around the need for markets to absorb the increased issuance of Government securities in a setting of costly portfolio adjustment. The paper concludes with some reflections on ""the Perverse Corollary of Stein's Law"" that is, the view that in the presence of large government deficits nothing need be done because something will be done""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Explaining the global pattern of current account imbalances,Finance,"""This paper assesses some of the explanations that have been put forward for the global pattern of current account imbalances that has emerged in recent years: in particular, the large U.S.  current account deficit and the large surpluses of the Asian developing economies.  Based on the approach developed by Chinn and Prasad (2003), we use data for 61 countries during 1982-2003 to estimate panel regression models for the ratio of the current account balance to GDP.  We find that a model that includes as its explanatory variables the standard determinants of current accounts proposed in the literature--per capita income, relative growth rates, the fiscal balance, demographic variables, and economic openness--can account for neither the large U.S.  deficit nor large Asian surpluses of the 1997-2003 period.  However, when we include a variable representing financial crises, which might be expected to restrain domestic demand and boost the current account balance, the model explains much of developing Asia's swing into surplus since 1997.  Even so, the model cannot explain why the capital outflows associated with Asia's current account surpluses were channeled primarily into the U.S.  economy.  Observers have pointed to strong growth performance and a favorable institutional environment as elements attracting foreign investment into the United States, and we found strong evidence that good performance in these areas significantly reduces the current account balance.  While a model incorporating these factors still fails to predict the large U.S.  current account deficit (and, in fact, predicts a slight surplus), it does predict a U.S.  current account balance that is relatively weaker than the aggregate balance of developing Asia""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Cash flows and discount rates, industry and country effects, and co-movement in stock returns",Finance,"""This paper examines the relative importance of global, country-specific, and industry-specific factors in both the cash flow and discount rate components of equity returns between 1995 and 2003.  Our framework draws upon previously separate literatures on country versus industry effects and (forward-looking) cash flow versus discount rate components of equity return innovations.  We apply the Campbell (1991) decomposition for industry-by-country, all-country, global industry, and world market index returns so we can produce a richer characterization of same-industry and same-country effects in stock returns.  Unlike previous equity return decomposition papers, we exploit information in equity analysts' earnings forecasts when projecting future variables from our reduced-form equation systems.  Our findings confirm previous research that finds patterns of correlation that suggest a richer underlying structure than just a single common global factor.  Furthermore, our results suggest that global, within-country, and same-industry effects are all important for both of the two key components of stock returns: news about future dividends and news about future discount rates.  In particular, within-industry covariation in news about future discount rates appears to be just as important as within-country covariation in news about future discount rates.  We also find that the idiosyncratic component of cash flow news is more important than the global component, while the reverse is true for news about future discount rates.  Our results are broadly consistent with co-movement in future discount rates arising from perceptions of common elements of risk, rather than national market segmentation""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
"Socio-economic status, health shocks, life satisfaction and mortality evidence from an increasing mixed proportional hazard model /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""The socio-economic gradient in health remains a controversial topic in economics and other social sciences. In this paper we develop a new duration model that allows for unobserved persistent individual-specific health shocks and provides new evidence on the roles of socio-economic characteristics in determining length of life using 19-years of high-quality panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. We also contribute to the rapidly growing literature on life satisfaction by testing if more satisfied people live longer. Our results clearly confirm the importance of income, education and marriage as important factors in determining longevity. For example, a one-log point increase in real household monthly income leads to a 12% decline in the probability of death. We find a large role for unobserved health shocks, with 5-years of shocks explaining the same amount of the variation in length of life as all the other observed individual and socio-economic characteristics (with the exception of age) combined. Individuals with a high level of life satisfaction when initially interviewed live significantly longer, but this effect is completely due to the fact that less satisfied individuals are typically less healthy. We are also able to confirm the findings of previous studies that self-assessed health status has significant explanatory power in predicting future mortality and is therefore a useful measure of morbidity. Finally, we suggest that the duration model developed in this paper is a useful tool when analyzing a wide-range of single-spell durations where individual-specific shocks are likely to be important""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
From efficiency-driven to innovation-driven economic growth perspectives from Singapore /,Finance,"""This paper looks at Singapore's efforts to transform the economic growth base from one that is predominantly efficiency-driven to one that is more innovation-driven.  To accelerate the transition process, the government is aggressively investing in ""innovation infrastructure""-systems and institutions that make the city a more conducive environment for innovations.  The modus operandi, with a distinctive ""winner-picking"" flavor, mirrors that of its earlier strategic industrial policy in building up the manufacturing sector.  It is also in sync with the new urban growth literature which argues that the success of any innovation-driven growth strategy depends on a city's ability to attract a large community of creative individuals in different fields.  Innovation infrastructure building requires more than putting in the right systems.  It also requires a mindset change at various levels of society.  This paper looks at how the government's policy philosophy and practices have evolved over time, and discusses the effectiveness of the government-led, strategic supply-push approach in propelling Singapore onto an innovation-driven growth path.  It takes into consideration the city-state's underlying comparative advantages (or disadvantages) and asks how Singapore's existing strength in efficiency infrastructure may give it a first mover advantage in attracting creative talent, how its success may be affected by the small size of the economy, and the various political and social constraints that a small sovereign city-state faces.  These issues are explored against the backdrop of the keen competition among the major cities in the region to become an innovation hub. ""--World Bank web site."
Public debt in developing countries has the market-based model worked? /,Finance,"""Over the past 25 years, significant levels of public debt and external finance are more likely to have enhanced macroeconomic vulnerability than economic growth in developing countries.  This applies not just to countries with a history of high inflation and past default, but also to those in East Asia, with a long tradition of prudent macroeconomic policies and rapid growth.  The authors examine why with the help of a conceptual framework drawn from the growth, capital flows, and crisis literature for developing countries with access to the international capital markets (market access countries or MACs).  They find that, while the chances of another generalized debt crisis have receded since the turbulence of the late 1990s, sovereign debt is indeed constraining growth in MACs, especially those with debt sustainability problems.  Several prominent MACs have sought to address the debt and external finance problem by generating large primary fiscal surpluses, switching to flexible exchange rates, and reforming fiscal and financial institutions.  Such country-led initiatives completely dominate attempts to overhaul the international financial architecture or launch new lending instruments, which have so far met with little success.  While the initial results of the countries' initiatives have been encouraging, serious questions remain about the viability of the model of market-based external development finance.  Beyond crisis resolution, which has received attention in the form of the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism, the international financial institutions may need to ramp up their role as providers of stable long-run development finance to MACs instead of exiting from them.

Predictable dynamics in the S&P 500 index options implied volatility surface,Economic theory,"""One key stylized fact in the empirical option pricing literature is the existence of an implied volatility surface (IVS).  The usual approach consists of fitting a linear model linking the implied volatility to the time to maturity and the moneyness, for each cross section of options data.  However, recent empirical evidence suggests that the parameters characterizing the IVS change over time.  In this paper we study whether the resulting predictability patterns in the IVS coefficients may be exploited in practice.  We propose a two-stage approach to modeling and forecasting the S&P 500 index options IVS.  In the first stage we model the surface along the cross-sectional moneyness and time-to-maturity dimensions, similarly to Dumas et al.  (1998).  In the second-stage we model the dynamics of the cross-sectional first-stage implied volatility surface coefficients by means of vector autoregression models.  We find that not only the S&P 500 implied volatility surface can be successfully modeled, but also that its movements over time are highly predictable in a statistical sense.  We then examine the economic significance of this statistical predictability with mixed findings.  Whereas profitable delta-hedged positions can be set up that exploit the dynamics captured by the model under moderate transaction costs and when trading rules are selective in terms of expected gains from the trades, most of this profitability disappears when we increase the level of transaction costs and trade multiple contracts off wide segments of the IVS.  This suggests that predictability of the time-varying S&P 500 implied volatility surface may be not inconsistent with market efficiency""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site."
"Why should we care about child labor? The education, labor market, and health consequences of child labor",Finance,"""Although there is extensive literature on the determinants of child labor and many initiatives aimed at combating it, there is limited evidence on the consequences of child labor on socioeconomic outcomes such as education, wages, and health.  Beegle, Dehejia, and Gatti evaluate the causal effect of child labor participation on these outcomes using panel data from Vietnam and an instrumental variables strategy.  Five years subsequent to the child labor experience, they find significant negative effects on school participation and educational attainment, but also find substantially higher earnings for those (young) adults who worked as children.  The authors find no significant effects on health.  Over a longer horizon, they estimate that from age 30 onward the forgone earnings attributable to lost schooling exceed any earnings gain associated with child labor and that the net present discounted value of child labor is positive for discount rates of 11.5 percent or higher.  The authors show that child labor is prevalent among households likely to have higher borrowing costs, that are farther from schools, and whose adult members experienced negative returns to their own education.  This evidence suggests that reducing child labor will require facilitating access to credit and will also require households to be forward looking.

"Corporate governance, economic entrenchment and growth",Economic theory,"""Around the world, large corporations usually have controlling owners, who are usually very wealthy families.  Outside the U.S.  and the U.K., pyramidal control structures, cross shareholding and super voting rights are common.  Using these devices, a family can control corporations without making a commensurate capital investment.  In many countries, such families end up controlling considerable proportions of their countries'' economies.  Three points emerge.  First, at the firm level, these ownership structures vest dominant control rights with families who often have little real capital invested creating agency and entrenchment problem simultaneously.  In addition, controlling shareholders can divert corporate resources for private benefits using transactions within the pyramidal group.  The result is a poor utilization of resources.  At the economy level, extensive control of corporate assets by a few families distorts capital allocation and reduces the rate of innovation.  The result is an economy-wide misallocation of resources, and slower economic growth.  Second, political influence is plausibly related to what one controls, rather than what one owns.  The controlling owners of pyramids thus have greatly amplified political influence relative to their actual wealth.  They appear to influence the development of both public policy, such as property rights protection and enforcement, and institutions like capital markets.  We denote this phenomenon economic entrenchment.  Third, we conceive of a relationship between the distribution of corporate control and institutional development that generates and preserves economic entrenchment as one equilibrium; but not the only one.  Based on the literature, we identify key determinants of economic entrenchment.  We also identify many gaps where further work exploring the political economy importance of the distribution of corporate control is needed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Environmental factors and children's malnutrition in Ethiopia,Finance,"""Ethiopia has one of the highest child malnutrition rates in the world.  A considerable effort to monitor child malnutrition rates over the past two decades shows that, despite some improvements, approximately half of the children under five are still malnourished.  Much of the burden of deaths resulting from malnutrition, estimated to be over half of childhood deaths in developing countries, can be attributed to mild or moderate malnutrition.  Several biological and social economic factors contribute to malnutrition.  Using the 2000 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data, Silva examines the impact of access to basic environmental services, such as water and sanitation, on the probability children are stunted and underweight.  She focuses on the impact of externalities associated with access to these services.  The author finds that biological factors (such as child's age and mother's height) and social economic factors (such as household wealth and mother's education) are important determinants of a child's nutritional status.  This is consistent with the findings of most studies in the literature.  With respect to the environmental factors, the author finds that there are indeed significant externalities associated with access to water and sanitation at the community level.  The external impacts at the community level of access to these services are an important determinant of the probability a child is underweight.  The results also show that the external impact of access to water is larger for children living in rural areas.

Home bias in trade location or foreign-ness? /,Economic theory,"With ""home bias,"" a consumer differentiates between domestic goods and imports and tends to purchase the domestic variety. A vast number of empirical studies in the international trade literature report the apparent prevalence of a large degree of home bias (the case of the ""missing trade"", the ""border puzzle"").  Many theoretical studies, in turn, assume its presence.  Despite this wide usage, the origins of home bias remain cloudy.  Do customs officials require extensive paper work, thus making imports prohibitively expensive? Is there some inherent distrust of a foreign product? This paper probes the causes of home bias.  I ask whether the apparent predilection to purchase domestic goods arises from (1) pure locational factors, such as tariffs or access to a local distribution network, or (2) an inherent preference for domestic goods per se.  I am able to make this decomposition through the use of data on the local sales of foreign affiliates of U.S.  multinational enterprises, in addition to data on U.S.  bilateral exports and domestic sales by host-country firms.  I find that the apparent tendency to purchase domestic goods rather than imports arises almost entirely from pure locational factors.  The ad valorem tariff-equivalent of producing at home and shipping to a different country ranges between 51 percent and 105 percent across industries.  However, if a firm establishes and sells from a subsidiary located in the foreign country, its local sales are nearly on a par with those of domestic firms in that market.  &quot;Foreign-ness&quot; in and of itself does not appear to impede purchases of imported goods""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Foreign lobbies and US trade policy,Economic theory,"""In popular discussion much has been made recently of the susceptibility of government policies to lobbying by foreigners.  The general presumption has also been that such interactions have a deleterious effect on the home economy.  However, it can be argued that, in a trade policy context, bending policy in a direction that would suit foreigners may not in fact be harmful: If the policy outcome absent any lobbying by foreigners is characterized by welfare-reducing trade barriers, lobbying by foreigners may result in reductions in such barriers and raise consumer surplus (and possibly improve welfare).  Using a new data set on foreign political activity in the US, this paper investigates the relationship between trade protection and lobbying activity empirically.  The approach taken in this paper is primarily a structural one.  To model the role of foreign and domestic lobbies in determining trade policy, we develop first a theoretical framework building on the well-known work of Grossman and Helpman (1994); the econometric work that follows is very closely linked to the theory.  Our analysis of the data suggests that foreign lobbying activity has significant impact on trade policy - and in the predicted direction: Tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) are both found to be negatively related with foreign lobbying activity.  We consider also extended specifications in which we include a large number of additional explanatory variables that have been suggested in the literature as determinants of trade policy (but that emerge from outside of the theoretical structure described above) and confirm the robustness of our findings in this setting""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Cohort turnover and productivity the july phenomenon in teaching hospitals /,Economic theory,"""The impact of labor turnover on productivity has received a great deal of attention in the literature on organizations.  We consider the impact of cohort turnover--the simultaneous exit of a large number of experienced employees and a similarly sized entry of new workers--on productivity in the context of teaching hospitals.  In particular, we examine the impact of the annual July turnover of house staff (i.e., residents and fellows) in American teaching hospitals on levels of resource utilization (measured by risk-adjusted length of hospital stay) and quality (measured by risk-adjusted mortality rates).  Using patient-level data from roughly 700 hospitals per year over the period from 1993 to 2001, we compare monthly trends in length of stay and mortality for teaching hospitals to those for non-teaching hospitals, which, by definition, do not experience systematic turnover in July.  We find that the annual house-staff turnover results in increased resource utilization (i.e., higher risk-adjusted length of hospital stay) for both minor and major teaching hospitals and decreased quality (i.e., higher risk-adjusted mortality rates) for major teaching hospitals.  Further, these effects with respect to mortality are not monotonically increasing in a hospital's reliance on residents for the provision of care.

The economic impacts of climate change evidence from agricultural profits and random fluctuations in weather /,Economic theory,"""This paper measures the economic impact of climate change on US agricultural land.  We replicate the previous literature's implementation of the hedonic approach and find that it produces estimates of the effect of climate change that are very sensitive to decisions about the appropriate control variables, sample and weighting.  We find estimates of the benchmark doubling of greenhouse gases on agricultural land values that range from a decline of $420 billion (1997$) to an increase of $265 billion, or 30% to 19%.  Despite its theoretical appeal, the wide variability of these estimates suggests that the hedonic method may be unreliable in this setting.  In light of the potential importance of climate change, this paper proposes a new strategy to determine its economic impact.  We estimate the effect of weather on farm profits, conditional on county and state by year fixed effects, so the weather parameters are identified from the presumably random variation in weather across counties within states.  The results suggest that the benchmark change in climate would reduce the value of agricultural land by $40 to $80 billion, or 3% to 6%, but the null of zero effect cannot be rejected.  In contrast to the hedonic approach, these results are robust to changes in specification.  Since farmers can engage in a more extensive set of adaptations in response to permanent climate changes, this estimate is likely downwards biased, relative to the preferred long run effect.  Together the point estimates and sign of the likely bias contradict the popular view that climate change will have substantial negative welfare consequences for the US agricultural sector""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."

Isolating the effect of major depression on obesity role of selection bias /,Economic theory,"""The NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health provides summaries of publications like this.  You can sign up to receive the NBER Bulletin on Aging and Health by email.  There is suggestive evidence that rates of major depression have risen markedly in the U.S.  concurrent with the rise in obesity.  The economic burden of depression, about $100 billion annually, is under-estimated if depression has a positive causal impact on obesity.  If depression plays a causal role in increasing the prevalence of obesity, then policy interventions aimed at promoting mental health may also have the indirect benefits of promoting a healthy bodyweight.  However, virtually the entire existing literature on the connection between the two conditions has examined merely whether they are significantly correlated, sometimes holding constant a limited set of demographic factors.  This study utilizes multiple large-scale nationally-representative datasets to assess whether, and the extent to which, the positive association reflects a causal link from major depression to higher BMI and obesity.  While contemporaneous effects are considered, the study primarily focuses on the effects of past and lifetime depression to bypass reverse causality and further assess the role of non-random selection on unobservable factors.  There are expectedly no significant or substantial effects of current depression on BMI or overweight/obesity, given that BMI is a stock measure that changes relatively slowly over time.  Results are also not supportive of a causal interpretation among males.  However, among females, estimates indicate that past or lifetime diagnosis of major depression raises the probability of being overweight or obese by about seven percentage points.  Results also suggest that this effect appears to plausibly operate through shifts in food consumption and physical activity.  We estimate that this higher risk of overweight and obesity among females could potentially add about 10% (or $9.7 billion) to the estimated economic burden of depression""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
State and federal approaches to health reform what works for the working poor? /,Economic theory,"""We compare and contrast the labor market and distributional impact of three common approaches to state and federal health insurance expansion: public insurance expansions, refundable tax credits for low income people, and employer and individual mandates.  We draw on existing estimates from the literature and individual-level data on the non-institutionalized population aged 64 and younger from the 2005 Current Population Survey to estimate how each approach affects (1) the number of people insured; (2) private and public health spending; (3) employment and wages; and (4) the distribution of subsidies across families based on income in relation to the federal poverty level and work status of adult family members.  Employer mandates expand coverage to the largest number of previously insured relative to public insurance expansions and individual tax credits, but with potentially negative labor market consequences.  Medicaid expansions could achieve moderate reductions in the share of the uninsured with neutral labor market consequences, and by definition, they expand coverage to the poorest groups regardless of work status.  Tax credits extend coverage to relatively few uninsured, but with neutral effects on the labor market.  Both Medicaid expansions and tax credits offer moderate redistribution to previously insured individuals who are poor or near-poor.  None of the three policies significantly expand insurance coverage among poor working families.  Our findings suggest that no single approach helps the working poor in exactly the ways policy makers might hope.  To the extent that states are motivated to help the uninsured in poor working families, health reforms must find ways to include those unlikely to take up optional policies, and states must address the challenge of the many uninsured likely to be excluded from policies based on part-time work status, firm size, or immigration status""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Level versus equivalent intensity carbon mitigation commitments,Economic theory,"""Large population / rapidly growing economies such as China and India have argued that in the upcoming UNFCCC negotiations in Copenhagen, any emission reduction targets they take on should be based on their intensity of emissions (emissions/$GDP) on a target date not the level of emissions. They argue that this will allow room for their continued high growth, and level commitments in the presence of sharply differential growth between OECD and non-OECD economies represent asymmetric and unacceptable arrangements. Much of the policy literature agrees with this position, also arguing that while there is equivalence between commitments if growth rates are certain, where growth rates are uncertain equivalence breaks down. However, no explicit models or experimental design are used to support this claim. Here we use a modeling framework in which countries face a business as usual (BAU) growth profile under no mitigation, and can mitigate (reduce consumption) and lower temperature change but with a utility loss. International trade enters through trade in country differentiated goods, and the impact of mitigation on country welfare depends critically on the assumed severity of climate related damage. We then consider cases where country growth rates are uncertain, and compare the impacts of levels versus intensity commitments, with the latter made equivalent in the sense that expected emissions are the same. There are different senses of this equivalence; global equivalence with differing country impacts, or strict country by country equivalence. Under intensity commitments there is more variation in both consumption and emissions than is the case with level commitments, and we show cases where level commitments are preferred to intensity commitments by all countries. Whether this is the case also depends upon how growth rate uncertainty is specified. We are also able to consider packages of mixed level and intensity commitments by country which might be the outcome of UNFCCC negotiations. Outcomes can thus be opposite to prevailing opinion, but it depends on how the equivalent targets are specified. ""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Risky human capital and deferred capital income taxation,Economic theory,"""We study the structure of optimal wedges and capital taxes in a Mirrlees economy with endogenous skills. Human capital is a private state variable that drives the skill process of each individual. Building on the findings of the labor literature, we assume that human capital investment is a) risky, b) made early in the life-cycle, and c) hard to distinguish from consumption. These assumptions lead to the optimality of a) a human capital premium, i.e., an excess return on human capital relative to physical capital, b) a large intertemporal wedge early in the life-cycle stemming from the lack of Rogerson's [Econometrica, 1985] ""inverse Euler"" characterization of the optimal consumption process, and c) an intra-temporal distortion of the effort/consumption margin even at the top of the skill distribution at all dates except the terminal date. The main implication for the structure of linear capital taxes is the necessity of deferred taxation of physical capital. In particular, deferred taxation of capital prevents the agents from making a joint deviation of under-investing in human capital ex ante and shirking from labor effort at some future date in the life-cycle, as the marginal deferred tax rate on physical capital held early in the life-cycle is history-dependent. The average marginal tax rate on physical capital held in every period is zero in present value. Thus, as in Kocherlakota [Econometrica, 2005], the government revenue from capital taxation is zero. However, since a portion of the capital tax must be deferred, expected capital tax payments cannot be zero in every period. Necessarily, agents face negative expected capital tax payments due early in the life-cycle and positive expected capital tax payments late in the life-cycle. Also, relative to economies with exogenous skills, the optimal marginal wealth tax rate is more volatile.""--Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond web site."
Choice of fields of study of Canadian university graduates the role of gender and their parents' education /,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""This paper examines the determinants of the choice of field of study by university students using data from the Canadian National Graduate Survey. The sample of 18,708 graduates holding a Bachelor degree is interesting in itself knowing that these students completed their study and thus represent a pool of high quality individuals. What impact expected post-graduation lifetime earnings have in choosing their field of study respectively to their non pecuniary preferences? Are these individuals less or more influenced by monetary incentives on their decision than was found in previous literature with samples of university students not all completing their studies successfully? Unlike existing studies, we account for the probability that students will be able to find employment related to their field of study when evaluating lifetime earnings after graduation. The parameters that drive students' choices of fields of study are estimated using a mixed multinomial logit model applied to seven broadly defined fields. Results indicate that the weight put by a student on initial earnings and earnings' rate of growth earnings depends upon the education level of the parent of the same gender. Surprisingly, lifetime earnings have no statistically significant impact when the parent of the same gender as the student has a university education. Results show that men are, in general, more sensitive than women to initial income variations, whilst women are more sensitive than men to the earnings' rate of growth variations. Marital status, enrolment status and the vocation identified with each field of study are influential factors in students' choices. From a policy perspective, a substantial increase in lifetime earnings, while all other factors remain constant, would be necessary to draw students into fields of study they are not inclined to choose initially""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
The impact of privatization on the performance of the infrastructure sector the case of electricity distribution in Latin American countries /,Finance,"""The authors analyze the impact of privatization on the performance of 116 electric utilities in 10 Latin American countries.  The analysis makes a number of contributions to the literature on changes in infrastructure ownership.  First, this is the first systemic analysis of the impact of privatization on the distribution of the electricity sector.  Second, it constructs an unbalanced panel data set of key indicators for each country.  Third, it includes a broader-than in past studies-range of indicators, such as output, employment, productivity, efficiency, quality, coverage, and prices, offering a fuller picture of the effects of privatization on consumers.  Fourth, this research covers a longer period of time, and evaluates three stages-before, transition, and after-allowing for the identification of the short- and long-run effects of privatization, as opposed to previous analyses' short time series data that do not identify long-run outcomes.  Finally, the counterfactual is considered through the analysis in trends.  The authors apply two different methodologies.  The first methodology uses means and medians from each period and tests the significance of the changes between periods.  The second methodology consists of an econometric model that captures firm fixed effects, firm-specific time trends, and heteroscedasticity corrections.  When needed, the authors used firm-specific time trends to better understand the outcomes.  The results suggest that changes in ownership generate significant improvements in labor productivity, efficiency, and product and service quality, and that most of those changes occur in the transition period.  Improvements in the post transition period-beyond two years after the change in ownership-are much more modest. ""--World Bank web site."
Productivity matters for trade policy theory and evidence /,Finance,"""There is a growing literature that investigates the effect of trade liberalization on productivity.  Nearly all such studies assume that trade policy is determined independently of productivity, hence it is exogenous.  The author shows that this assumption is not valid in general, both theoretically and empirically, and that researchers may be underestimating the positive effect of liberalization on productivity when they do not account for the endogeneity bias.  On the theory side, he demonstrates that under a standard political economy model of trade protection, productivity directly influences tariffs.  Moreover, this productivity-tariff relationship partly determines the extent of liberalization across sectors even in the presence of a large exogenous unilateral liberalization shock that affects all sectors.  The link between productivity and tariffs is maintained after the author includes in his political economy model a learning-by-doing motive of protection, which also serves as the source of liberalization.  On the empirical side, he examines total factor productivity (TFP) estimates obtained at the firm level for Colombia between 1983 and 1998, and finds that more productive sectors receive more protection within this period.  In estimating the effect of productivity on tariffs, he controls for the endogeneity of the two main right-hand-side variables-the inverse import penetration to import demand elasticity ratio and productivity-by using materials prices, the capital to output ratio, a measure of scale economies, and the TFP of the upstream industries as robust instruments.  The author also accounts for the large trade liberalization between 1990 and 1992, and finds that the sectors with a higher productivity gain are liberalized less.  Finally, he illustrates a system of equations estimation and shows that the positive impact of liberalization on productivity grows stronger when corrected for the endogeneity bias.

Uses and abuses of empirical evidence in the death penalty debate,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""Does the death penalty save lives? A surge of recent interest in this question has yielded a series of papers purporting to show robust and precise estimates of a substantial deterrent effect of capital punishment. We assess the various approaches that have been used in this literature, testing the robustness of these inferences. Specifically, we start by assessing the time series evidence, comparing the history of executions and homicides in the United States and Canada, and within the United States, between executing and non-executing states. We analyze the effects of the judicial experiments provided by the Furman and Gregg decisions and assess the relationship between execution and homicide rates in state panel data since 1934. We then revisit the existing instrumental variables approaches and assess two recent state-specific execution moratoria. In each case we find that previous inferences of large deterrent effects based upon specific samples, functional forms, control variables, comparison groups, or IV strategies are extremely fragile and even small changes in specifications yield dramatically different results. The fundamental difficulty is that the death penalty -- at least as it has been implemented in the United States -- is applied so rarely that the number of homicides that it can plausibly have caused or deterred cannot be reliably disentangled from the large year-to-year changes in the homicide rate caused by other factors. As such, short samples and particular specifications may yield large but spurious correlations. We conclude that existing estimates appear to reflect a small and unrepresentative sample of the estimates that arise from alternative approaches. Sampling from the broader universe of plausible approaches suggests not just ""reasonable doubt"" about whether there is any deterrent effect of the death penalty, but profound uncertainty -- even about its sign""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Evaluating alternative representations of the choice sets in models of labour supply,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""During the last two decades, the discrete-choice modelling of labour supply decisions has become increasingly popular, starting with Aaberge et al. (1995) and van Soest (1995). Within the literature adopting this approach there are however two potentially important issues that are worthwhile analyzing in their implications and that so far have not been given the attention they might deserve. A first issue concerns the procedure by which the discrete alternatives are selected to enter the choice set. For example van Soest (1995) chooses (non-probabilistically) a set of fixed points identical for every individual. This is by far the most widely adopted method. By contrast, Aaberge et al. (1995) adopt a sampling procedure suggested by McFadden (1978) and also assume that the choice set may differ across the households. A second issue concerns the availability of the alternatives. Most authors assume all the values of hours-of-work within some range [0, H] are equally available. At the other extreme, some authors assume only two or three alternatives (e.g. non-participation, part-time and full-time) are available for everyone. Aaberge et al. (1995) assume instead that not all the hour opportunities are equally available to everyone; they specify a probability density function of opportunities for each individual and the discrete choice set used in the estimation is built by sampling from that individual-specific density function. In this paper we explore by simulation the implications of the procedure used to build the choice set (fixed alternatives vs. sampled alternatives) and of accounting or not accounting for a different availability of alternatives. The way the choice set is represented seems to have little impact on the fitting of observed values, but a more significant and important impact on the out-of-sample prediction performance""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Trade, peace and democracy an analysis of dyadic dispute /","Industries, Land use, Labor","""At least since 1750 when Baron de Montesquieu declared ""peace is the natural effect of trade,"" a number of economists and political scientists espoused the notion that trade among nations leads to peace. Employing resources wisely to produce one commodity rather than employing them inefficiently to produce another is the foundation for comparative advantage. Specialization based on comparative advantage leads to gains from trade. If political conflict leads to a diminution of trade, then at least a portion of the costs of conflict can be measured by a nation's lost gains from trade. The greater two nations' gain from trade the more costly is bilateral (dyadic) conflict. This notion forms the basis of Baron de Montesquieu's assertion regarding dyadic dispute. This paper develops an analytical framework showing that higher gains from trade between two trading partners (dyads) lowers the level of conflict between them. It describes data necessary to test this hypothesis, and it outlines current developments and extensions taking place in the resulting trade-conflict literature. Cross-sectional evidence using various data on political interactions confirms that trading nations cooperate more and fight less. A doubling of trade leads to a 20% diminution of belligerence. This result is robust under various specifications, and it is upheld when adjusting for causality using cross-section and time-series techniques. Further, the impact of trade is strengthened when bilateral import demand elasticities are incorporated to better measure gains from trade. Because democratic dyads trade more than non-democratic dyads, democracies cooperate with each other relatively more, thereby explaining the ""democratic peace"" that democracies rarely fight each other. The paper then goes on to examine further extensions of the trade-conflict model regarding specific commodity trade, foreign direct investment, tariffs, foreign aid, country contiguity, and multilateral interactions""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Business environment and labor market outcomes in Europe and Central Asia countries,Finance,"""New firm entry has been fundamental for job creation in the transition economies.  Hence, the urge to reform the framework in which firms operate.  This paper aims to improve our understanding of the business environment of the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) countries, as well as to assess which of the institutions that shape it are most important for labor market performance.  To achieve that aim, the author groups the institutions into those affecting firm entry and those affecting business survival and growth, and proceeds to construct indicators to summarize them.  Next, she analyzes the impact of the business environment institutions on the employment generated by the private sector of the countries, proxied by the service employment rate.  The regression analysis uses an unbalanced panel of 28 ECA countries over 14 years-from 1988 to 2002.  Recent literature on the labor market performance of the OECD countries argues that what matters for employment is the interaction between institutions and shocks.  Accordingly, the explanatory variables used in the regression are the interactions between the transition shock suffered by the ECA countries and each of the business environment institutions previously defined.  The author finds that access to finance is the most important institution across all ECA countries.  The development of the financial sector can explain about 40 percent of private employment creation in the European transition economies according to the model.  On the other hand, the poor access to finance in Bulgaria, Croatia, and above all, Romania, is the main factor behind their poor development of the private sector.  Market regulation (credit and labor regulation), start-up costs, and the tax burden are all found to significantly affect employment as well.   ""--World Bank web site."
Border effects and the availability of domestic products abroad,Economic theory,"""Borders have a sizable negative impact on trade flows.  Given the vast number of individual goods potentially traded, this ""border effect""could have two possible explanations: (1) less international than domestic trade in the goods that are actually traded between countries (""flow""), or (2) differences between the sets of goods traded internationally and domestically--that is, fewer goods are available as exports than are sold in the home market (""availability"").  Most of the previous literature on border effects has ignored the possible role of this second factor, instead reporting a single border effect that contains the embedded assumption that identical sets of goods are available in the domestic and export markets.  In contrast to this assumption, evidence on the activities of firms shows that only a fraction of domestic products areactually exported.  This paper provides theoretical and empirical work that incorporates the distinction between the flow and availability explanations of border effects.  A model that includes heterogeneous fixed costs of trade illustrates how either of these two factors could underlie a given border effect.  The empirical work incorporates the fact that not all firms export by examining only the fraction of total domestic production attributable to those firms that actually do sell abroad.  The results suggest that a portion of the border effect is indeed due to differences between the sets of goods available domestically and internationally.  I find that, on average across industries, about one-half of the border effect is due to the flow explanation, while the remaining half may be attributed to availability.  Given that the policy and welfare implications of border effects depend on the relative importance of these two explanations, future work should take care to specify clearly which aspect of the border effect is being measured""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site."
Export variety and country productivity,Finance,"""Feenstra and Kee study the link between export product variety and country productivity based on data from 34 industrial and developing countries, from 1982 to 1997.  They measure export product variety by the share of U.S. imports on the set of goods exported by each sampled country relative to the world.  It is a theoretically sound index which is consistent with within-country GDP maximization, as well as cross-country comparison.  The authors construct country productivity based on relative endowments and product variety.  Increases in output product variety improve country productivity as the new mix of output may better use resources of the economy and improve allocative efficiency.  Such effects depend on the elasticity of substitution in production between the different varieties.  The more different the varieties are in terms of production, the more efficient it is to use the endowments of the economy when a new variety is available, which leads to productivity gains.  In addition, as suggested in the literature, export product variety depends on trade costs, such as tariffs, distance, and transport costs.  Such trade cost variables are used as instruments to help the authors identify the effects of export variety on country productivity.  Empirical evidence supports their hypothesis.  Overall, while export variety accounts for only 2 percent of cross-country productivity differences, it explains 13 percent of within-country productivity growth.  A 10 percent increase in the export variety of all industries leads to a 1.3 percent increase in country productivity, while a 10 percentage point increase in tariffs facing an exporting country leads to a 2 percent fall in country productivity.

Designing performance the semi-autonomous revenue authority model in Africa and Latin America /,Finance,"""During the past decade, diverse developing countries have introduced radical reforms in their collection of taxes.  In more than 15 countries, traditional tax departments have been granted the status of semiautonomous revenue authorities (ARAs), which are designed with a number of autonomy-enhancing features, including self-financing mechanisms, boards of directors with high-ranking public and private sector representatives, and sui generis personnel systems.  Taliercio addresses gaps in the public management and tax administration literatures by closely examining ARA reforms in Kenya, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Uganda, and Venezuela from their inception to the early 2000s.  Using the comparative case study method, he tackles three questions.  First, what has motivated the wave of ARA reforms over the past decade? The author argues that from a public management perspective, reformers intended to use autonomy to enhance bureaucratic performance in low-capacity public sectors.  Second, is there a connection between autonomy and performance? Focusing on revenue collection, compliance management, taxpayer services, human resource management, and administrative costs, the author suggests that autonomy is associated with higher levels of performance.  He also makes the case that higher levels of autonomy are associated with higher levels of performance.  Third, if there is a connection between autonomy and performance, which specific design features matter most and why? In spite of the popularity of the ARA reform, there is no consensus on best practice in organizational design.  The author offers hypotheses based on the cases about why certain designs work better than others, and makes specific recommendations for the next generation of ARA reforms.  This paper a product of the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Sector Department, East Asia and Pacific Region is part of a larger effort in the Bank to understand under what conditions public sector performance improves""--World Bank web site."
A structural analysis of the correlated random coefficient wage regression model with an application to the ols-iv puzzle,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""We estimate a finite mixture dynamic programming model of schooling decisions in which the log wage regression function is set within a correlated random coefficient model and we use the structural estimates to perform counterfactual experiments. We show that the estimates of the dynamic programming model with a rich heterogeneity specification, along with simulated schooling/wage histories, may be used to obtain estimates of the average treatment effects (ATE), the average treatment effects for the treated and the untreated (ATT/ATU), the marginal treatment effect (MTE) and, finally, the local average treatment effects (LATE). The model is implemented on a panel of white males taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) from 1979 until 1994. We find that the average return to experience upon entering the labor market (0.059) exceeds the average return to schooling in the population (0.043). The importance of selectivity based on individual specific returns to schooling is illustrated by the difference between the average returns for those who have not attended college (0.0321) and those who attended college (0.0645). Our estimate of the MTE (0.0573) lies between the ATU and ATT and exceeds the average return in the population. Interestingly, the low average wage return is compatible with the occurrence of very high returns to schooling in some subpopulation (the highest type specific return is 0.13) and the simulated IV estimates (around 0.10) are comparable to those very high estimates often reported in the literature. The high estimates are explained by the positive correlation between the returns to schooling and the individual specific reactions. Moreover, they are not solely attributable to those individuals who are at the margin, but also to those individuals who would achieve a higher grade level no matter what. The structural dynamic programming model with multi-dimensional heterogeneity is therefore capable of explaining the well known OLS/IV puzzle""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
"Remittances transaction costs, determinants, and informal flows /",Finance,"""Recorded workers' remittances to developing countries have grown rapidly, to more than $100 billion in 2004, bringing increasing attention to these flows as a potential tool for development.  But even these statistics are likely to significantly understate true remittances, as a large share is believed to flow through informal channels.  Estimates of the importance of the informal sector vary widely, ranging from 35 percent to 250 percent of total remittances.  The primary motivation of the authors is to develop the first empirical methodology to estimate informal flows.  They use insights from the literature on shadow economies and empirically estimate informal remittances for more than 100 countries using historical data on the balance of payments (BOP), migration, transaction costs, and country characteristics.  Their results imply that informal remittances amount to about 35-75 percent of official remittances to developing countries.  There is significant regional variation: informal remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe and Central Asia are relatively high, while those to East Asia and the Pacific are relatively low.  These estimates are supplemented with detailed household survey data on remittance receipts in a number of countries.  The results also shed light on the determinants of recorded remittances and the associated fees in the formal sector.  The authors find that the stock of migrants in OECD countries is the primary determinant of remittances.  In addition, money transfer fees and the presence of dual exchange rates reduce the share of remittances reported in national accounts.  In turn, transaction costs are systematically related to concentration in the banking sector, lack of financial depth, and exchange rate volatility.  There is also evidence that remittances are misrecorded in the BOP as ""errors and omissions."" ""--World Bank web site."
American depositary receipts (adr) holdings of U.S. based emerging market funds,Finance,"""For a foreign ""issuer,"" the benefits of cross-listing in the United States are extensively documented in the literature.  However it is not clear what motivates ""investors"" to hold American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) rather than the underlying stock of these issuers.  The authors address the investors' choice to purchase local shares versus investing in ADRs.  Specifically, they analyze the investment allocation decision of mutual fund managers to invest in emerging market firms that are listed in their domestic markets and have also issued ADRs in the United States.  Although legal provisions (governance/investor protection) are typically assumed to affect ADRs and their underlying domestic shares equally, investors holding ADRs may have a higher level of legal protection as these securities are issued and traded in the United States.  The authors' results are consistent with this ""better legal protection"" hypothesis as they find that funds prefer to hold ADRs rather than the underlying shares if the issuer is from a country with weak investor protection laws.  Also, theoretical models of multiple trading exchanges predict that trading should tend to aggregate in the market with the lowest transaction costs.  Similarly, the relative liquidity of an ADR compared to that of its underlying stock should also affect the funds' relative holding of the ADR versus the underlying stock.  Consistent with this ""ease of transaction"" hypothesis the authors find that if an issuer is based in a country with a relatively small stock market, low level of trading volume, and high transaction costs, funds tend to hold a larger proportion of their investments in the ADR.  Furthermore, funds hold a larger fraction of their investment in the ADR if the ADR trading volume is high relative to its domestic security trading volume.  The results also suggest that ADR listings of local firms might not negatively affect local markets if the investment climate is good. ""--World Bank web site."
Firm-specific capital and the new-Keynesian Phillips curve,Economic theory,"""A relation between inflation and the path of average marginal cost (often measured by unit labor cost) implied by the Calvo (1983) model of staggered pricing --- sometimes referred to as the ""new-Keynesian Phillips curve""--- has been the subject of extensive econometric estimation and testing.  Standard theoretical justifications of this form of aggregate-supply relation, however, either assume (i) the existence of a competitive rental market for capital services, so that the shadow cost of capital services is equated across firms and sectors at all points in time, despite the fact that prices are set at different times, or (ii) that the capital stock of each firm is constant, or at any rate exogenously given, and so independent of the firm's pricing decision.  But neither assumption is realistic.  The present paper examines the extent to which existing empirical specifications and interpretations of parameter estimates are compromised by reliance on either of these assumptions.The paper derives an aggregate-supply relation for a model with monopolistic competition and Calvo pricing in which capital is firm-specific and endogenous, and investment is subject to convex adjustment costs.  The aggregate-supply relation is shown to again take the standard ""new-Keynesian"" form, but with an elasticity of inflation with respect to real marginal cost that is a different function of underlying parameters than in the simpler cases studied earlier.  Thus the relations estimated in the empirical literature remain correctly specified under the assumptions proposed here, but the interpretation of the estimated elasticity is different; in particular, the implications of the estimated Phillips-curve slope for the frequency of price adjustment is changed.  Assuming a rental market for capital results in a substantial exaggeration of the infrequency of price adjustment; assuming exogenous capital instead results in a smaller under-estimate""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Wage differentials and international trade in Italy using individual micro data 1991-1996,"Industries, Land use, Labor","""In this paper we use individual micro data on workers combined with industry and regional data to study the dynamics of the wage differential between skilled and unskilled workers in Italy in the period 1991-1996. Being different to previous empirical studies, our data allow us to explore in a unique framework, the role of all the factors indicated in the literature as possible causes of the widening of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers: changes in the individual characteristics of workers, changes in the institutions of the labour market, in skill-biased technological progress and increasing international integration. Our results show that individual, firm and macro variables matter in explaining wage differentials. In particular, international integration, both in terms of trade in goods and in terms of international labour mobility, plays a role in determining the wage differential between skilled and unskilled workers, but the impact is in opposite directions. While, on the one hand, increasing trade in goods reduces wage differentials (through a positive impact on the wages of the unskilled workers), on the other hand immigration increases wage differentials, affecting the wage of the unskilled. As for the role of trade in goods, it is interesting to note that export growth has a positive impact on the wages of the blue collar workers and has no effect on the wages of the white collars, supporting the idea that Italy is atypical with respect to other industrialised countries and has a comparative advantage in low-skilled labour-intensive production. We have also shown that an analysis of the wage differentials hides their different effects on the white and blue collar wage dynamics of the explicative variables""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site."
Linking external sector imbalances and changing financial instability before the 2008 financial crisis,Economic theory,"""The G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth builds on the claim that growing imbalances before the 2008 Financial Crisis were a major cause of the crisis, and the further claim that reducing imbalances post crisis must be a central part of any effort to prevent a further occurrence.  Analytical literature in economics seemingly does not provide satisfactory measures of financial instability, either in individual national economies or in the combined global economy; nor ways of linking imbalance change to either worsening or improving financial (or real) instability and the onset of financial crises.  Here we focus on the external sector component of financial instability and link changes in country imbalances to individual economy growth rates in ways when summed across countries produce indices of expected worsening or improving financial instability at different points in time.  We compute a variety of such indices for the years immediately before the 2008 Financial Crisis.  We use the sum of the absolute value of external sector imbalances across countries (the trade imbalance, or the current account imbalance) as a proportion of the combined GDP of countries and link them in various ways to country growth rates.  An increasing measure under an index is an indication of future widening excess demands and supplies over all countries as a group relative to gross world product.  This, in turn, is an indication of increasing severity of adjustment problems ahead, and hence expected worsening financial instability.  We compute such indices for all G20 countries, and various subsets of countries (G2, G8, G8+5) and examine their behavior over the period 2004-2007.  Our results suggest that depending upon the index used and the base date chosen for comparative purposes in determining changes, different implications emerge for the linkage between external sector imbalances, perceived future instability and hence the onset of a financial crisis.  The implication we drawn is that the links between imbalances and both the onset and best policy response to the 2008 Financial Crisis asserted by the G20 may be more tenuous than claimed.  Indeed no such links were suggested earlier for the 1930s, the Asian Financial Crisis or any other crisis.  In turn economies have functioned with larger imbalances relative to GDP than in 2008 for considerable periods of time and with no financial implosion (UK in the pre World War I period; Germany and Australia in the 1990s)""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Market valuation of accrued social security benefits,Economic theory,"""One measure of the health of the Social Security system is the difference between the market value of the trust fund and the present value of benefits accrued to date.  How should present values be computed for this calculation in light of future uncertainties? We think it is important to use market value.  Since claims on accrued benefits are not currently traded in financial markets, we cannot directly observe a market value.  In this paper, we use a model to estimate what the market price for these claims would be if they were traded.  In valuing such claims, the key issue is properly adjusting for risk.  The traditional actuarial approach the approach currently used by the Social Security Administration in generating its most widely cited numbers - ignores risk and instead simply discounts ""expected"" future flows back to the present using a risk-free rate.  If benefits are risky and this risk is priced by the market, then actuarial estimates will differ from market value.  Effectively, market valuation uses a discount rate that incorporates a risk premium.  Developing the proper adjustment for risk requires a careful examination of the stream of future benefits.  The U.S.  Social Security system is ""wage-indexed"": future benefits depend directly on future realizations of the economy-wide average wage index.  We assume that there is a positive long-run correlation between average labor earnings and the stock market.  We then use derivative pricing methods standard in the finance literature to compute the market price of individual claims on future benefits, which depend on age and macro state variables.  Finally, we aggregate the market value of benefits across all cohorts to arrive at an overall value of accrued benefits.  We find that the difference between market valuation and ""actuarial"" valuation is large, especially when valuing the benefits of younger cohorts.  Overall, the market value of accrued benefits is only 4/5 of that implied by the actuarial approach.  Ignoring cohorts over age 60 (for whom the valuations are the same), market value is only 70% as large as that implied by the actuarial approach""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Measurement matters for modeling U.S. import prices,Finance,"""We focus on capturing the increasingly important role that emerging economies play in determining U.S.  import prices.  Emerging market producers differ from others in two respects: (1) their cost structure is well below that of developed-market producers, and (2) their wide profit margins induce pricing policies that seek to exhaust production capacity.  We argue that these features have dampened the short-run responses of import prices to changes in the value of the dollar but that they have not altered the associated long-run response.  To capture these considerations, we develop a new method to measure foreign prices and adopt a formulation that differentiates between short- and long-run responses.  Our econometric work asks two questions: First, can one replicate the literature's dispersion of pass-through estimates? Second, is there any evidence of a change in the dynamic response of import prices to changes in the exchange value of the dollar? To address the first question, we estimate the parameters of our models using several alternative measures of U.S.  and foreign prices, dynamic specifications, and sample periods.  We find that these alternative inputs translate into a large range of parameter estimates, a finding that helps to rationalizing the existing dispersion of estimates.  To address the second question, we compute the implied dynamic adjustment of import prices to a change in the value of the dollar using parameters estimated from two samples: 1974-2000 and 1974-2005.  The long-run response of import prices is similar regardless of which sample is used---roughly one-half of the change in the exchange rate is passed through to import prices.  However, the short-run response is quite sensitive to the sample period.  Specifically, the short-run response based on data through 2005 is smaller than the short-run response based on data through 2000.  We argue that one force behind the change in dynamics of the import-price process is the greater presence of producers from emerging economies and that their effect on import prices can be captured with their measure of foreign prices""--Federal Reserve Board web site."
Financial risk in the biotechnology industry,Economic theory,"""The biotechnology industry has been an engine of innovation for the U.S.  healthcare system and, more generally, the U.S.  economy.  It is by far the most research intensive industry in the U.S.  In our analyses in the current paper, for example, we find that, over the past 25 years, average R&D intensity (R&D spending to total firm assets) for this industry was 38 percent.  Consider that over this same period average R&D intensity for all industries was only about 3 percent.  In the current paper we examine this industry along a number of dimensions and estimate its average financial risk.  Specifically, we use Compustat and Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) data from 1982 to 2005 for firms defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as biotechnology firms to estimate several Fama-French three factor return models.  The finance literature has established this model as the gold standard.  Single factor models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) do not capture all of the types of systematic risk that influence firm cost of capital.  In particular, the CAPM does not reflect the empirical evidence that supports both a size-related and a book-to-market related systematic risk factor .  Both of these factors, based on biotech industry characteristics, will exert a greater influence on biotech firms, on average.  Another implication is, of course, that cost of capital estimates for the industry will be underestimated when a single factor model, like the CAPM, is used.  This also implies that the cost estimates of bringing a new drug and/or biologic to market will be understated if financial risk and cost of capital are measured using a single-factor model.  In the current study we find that biotechnology firms are exposed to greater financial risk than other industries and are also more sensitive to policy shocks that affect, or could affect, industry profitability.  Average nominal costs of capital over the 1982-2005 time period were 16.25 percent for biotechnology firms.  Of course, these average estimates obscure significant variation in financial risk at the firm level, but nonetheless shed light on some interesting aggregate differences in risk.  In the current paper we discuss the theoretical links between financial risk, stock prices and returns, and R&D spending.  Several caveats are also discussed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Managing the effects of tax expenditures on national budgets,Finance,"""Tax expenditures, in the form of tax provisions, are government expenditures.  They are conceptually and functionally distinct from those tax provisions whose purpose is to raise revenue.  Tax expenditure programs are comparable to entitlement programs.  Therefore, tax expenditures must be analyzed in spending terms and integrated into the budgetary process to ensure fiscal accountability.  In addition, tax expenditures must be audited for performance and the information must be published (with comprehensive analysis) to ensure fiscal transparency.  The author analyzes the concept and definition, size, and effects of tax expenditures, as well as the fiscal accountability and transparency of tax expenditure spending.  In short, tax expenditures affect (1) the budget balance, (2) budget prioritization in allocation, (3) the effectiveness and efficiency of fiscal resources, and (4) the scope for abuse by taxpayers, government officials and legislators.  While reviewing the current practices in tax expenditures against the requirements of fiscal accountability and transparency, she finds that this fiscal area must be strengthened.  The author sketches four building blocks to strengthen tax expenditures toward fiscal accountability and transparency, based on the literature developed by Surry and McDaniel, the practices from industrial and developing countries, the Campos and Pradhan fiscal accountability model, and the International Monetary Fund's fiscal transparency code.  The author argues that normative/benchmark tax structure, a revenue-raising component of the tax system, should be formalized.  The normative/benchmark tax structure should be legally defined in the tax law and should be transparent.  The tax receipts from this normative/benchmark tax structure should be quantified and published.  Presently, many countries could publish imputed tax revenue from normative/benchmark tax structures because such data is available.  Only if imputed tax revenue is published in the same way as the other budget components-tax revenue received, tax expenditures, direct expenditures, and fiscal balance-will a budget system be truly transparent in terms of revenue-raising activities and expenditure activities.  In addition, when the tax revenue-raising activity is formalized, the inherent spending nature of tax expenditures is further exposed.  Therefore, tax expenditures should be added to direct expenditures forming total government expenditures.  Furthermore, the conventional concept of the size of government should be remedied by including both direct expenditures and tax expenditures. ""--World Bank web site."
Is the international diversification potential diminishing? foreign equity inside and outside the us /,Economic theory,"""Over the past two decades international markets have become more open, leading to a common perception that global capital markets have become more integrated.  In this paper, I ask what this integration and its resulting higher correlation would imply about the diversification potential across countries.  For this purpose, I examine two basic groups of international returns: (1) foreign market indices and (2) foreign stocks that are listed and traded in the US.  I examine the first group since this is the standard approach in the international diversification literature, while I study the second group since some have argued that US-listed foreign stocks are the more natural diversification vehicle (Errunza et al (1999)).  In order to consider the possibility of shifts in the covariance of returns over time, I extend the break-date estimation approach of Bai and Perron (1998) to test for and estimate possible break dates across returns along with their confidence intervals.  I find that the covariances among country stock markets have indeed shifted over time for a majority of the countries.  But in contrast to the common perception that markets have become significantly more integrated over time, the covariance between foreign markets and the US market have increased only slightly from the beginning to the end of the last twenty years.  At the same time, the foreign stocks in the US markets have become significantly more correlated with the US market.  To consider the economic significance of these parameter changes, I use the estimates to examine the implications for a simple portfolio decision model in which a US investor could choose between US and foreign portfolios.  When restricted to holding foreign assets in the form of market indices, I find that the optimal allocation in foreign market indices actually increases over time.  However, the optimal allocation into foreign stocks decreases when the investor is allowed to hold foreign stocks that are traded in the US.  Also, the minimum variance attainable by the foreign portfolios has increased over time.  These results suggest that the benefits to diversification have declined both for stocks inside and outside the US""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Skills, tasks and technologies implications for employment and earnings /",Economic theory,"""A central organizing framework of the voluminous recent literature studying changes in the returns to skills and the evolution of earnings inequality is what we refer to as the canonical model, which elegantly and powerfully operationalizes the supply and demand for skills by assuming two distinct skill groups that perform two different and imperfectly substitutable tasks or produce two imperfectly substitutable goods.  Technology is assumed to take a factor-augmenting form, which, by complementing either high or low skill workers, can generate skill biased demand shifts.  In this paper, we argue that despite its notable successes, the canonical model is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades, including: (1) significant declines in real wages of low skill workers, particularly low skill males; (2) non-monotone changes in wages at different parts of the earnings distribution during different decades; (3) broad-based increases in employment in high skill and low skill occupations relative to middle skilled occupations (i.e., job 'polarization'); (4) rapid diffusion of new technologies that directly substitute capital for labor in tasks previously performed by moderately-skilled workers; and (5) expanding offshoring opportunities, enabled by technology, which allow foreign labor to substitute for domestic workers in specific tasks.  Motivated by these patterns, we argue that it is valuable to consider a richer framework for analyzing how recent changes in the earnings and employment distribution in the United States and other advanced economies are shaped by the interactions among worker skills, job tasks, evolving technologies, and shifting trading opportunities.  We propose a tractable task-based model in which the assignment of skills to tasks is endogenous and technical change may involve the substitution of machines for certain tasks previously performed by labor.  We further consider how the evolution of technology in this task-based setting may be endogenized.  We show how such a framework can be used to interpret several central recent trends, and we also suggest further directions for empirical exploration""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Do developed and developing countries compete head to head in high-tech?,Economic theory,"""Concerns that (1) growth in developing countries could worsen the US terms of trade and (2) that increased US trade with developing countries will increase US wage inequality both implicitly reflect the assumption that goods produced in the United States and developing countries are close substitutes and that specialization is incomplete.  In this paper we show on the contrary that there are distinctive patterns of international specialization and that developed and developing countries export fundamentally different products, especially those classified as high tech.  Judged by export shares, the United States and developing countries specialize in quite different product categories that, for the most part, do not overlap.  Moreover, even when exports are classified in the same category, there are large and systematic differences in unit values that suggest the products made by developed and developing countries are not very close substitutes-developed country products are far more sophisticated.  This generalization is already recognized in the literature but it does not hold for all types of products.  Export unit values of developed and developing countries of primary commodity-intensive products are typically quite similar.  Unit values of standardized (low-tech) manufactured products exported by developed and developing countries are somewhat similar.  By contrast, the medium- and high-tech manufactured exports of developed and developing countries differ greatly.This finding has important implications.  While measures of across product specialization suggest China and other Asian economies have been moving into high-tech exports, the within-product unit value measures indicate they are doing so in the least sophisticated market segments and the gap in unit values between their exports and those of developed countries has not narrowed over time.  These findings shed light on the paradoxical finding, exemplified by computers and electronics, that US-manufactured imports from developing countries are concentrated in US industries, which employ relatively high shares of skilled American workers.  They help explain why America's nonoil terms of trade have improved and suggest that recently declining relative import prices from developing countries may not produced significant wage inequality in the United States.  Finally they suggest that inferring competitive trends based on trade balances in products classified as ""high tech"" or ""advanced"" can be highly misleading""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
What caused the decline in U.S. business cycle volatility?,Economic theory,"""This paper investigates the sources of the widely noticed reduction in the volatility of American business cycles since the mid 1980s.  Our analysis of reduced volatility emphasizes the sharp decline in the standard deviation of changes in real GDP, of the output gap, and of the inflation rate.The primary results of the paper are based on a small three-equation macro model that includes equations for the inflation rate, the nominal Federal Funds rate, and the change in the output gap.  The development and analysis of the model goes beyond the previous literature in two directions.  First, instead of quantifying the role of shocks-in-general, it decomposes the effect of shocks between a specific set of supply shock variables in the model's inflation equation, and the error term in the output gap equation that is interpreted as representing 'IS' shifts or 'demand shocks'.  It concludes that the reduced variance of shocks was the dominant source of reduced business-cycle volatility.  Supply shocks accounted for 80 percent of the volatility of inflation before 1984 and demand shocks the remainder.  The high level of output volatility before 1984 is accounted for roughly two-thirds by the output errors (demand shocks) and the remainder by supply shocks.  The output errors are tied to the paper's initial decomposition of the demand side of the economy, which concludes that three sectors--residential and inventory investment and Federal government spending, account for 50 percent in the reduction in the average standard deviation of real GDP when the 1950-83 and 1984-2004 intervals are compared.The second innovation in this paper is to reinterpret the role of changes in Fed monetary policy.  Previous research on Taylor rule reaction functions identifies a shift after 1979 in the Volcker era toward inflation fighting with no concern about output, and then a shift in the Greenspan era to a combination of inflation fighting along with strong countercyclical responses to positive or negative output gaps.  Our results accept this characterization of the Volcker era but find that previous estimates of Greenspan-era reaction functions are plagued by positive serial correlation.  Once a correction for serial correlation is applied, the Greenspan-era reaction function looks almost identical to the pre-1979 “Burns” reaction function!""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Trends in U.S. wage inequality re-assessing the revisionists /,Economic theory,"""A large literature documents a substantial rise in U.S.  wage inequality and educational wage differentials over the past several decades and finds that these trends can be primarily accounted for by shifts in the supply of and demand for skills reinforced by the erosion of labor market institutions affecting the wages of low- and middle-wage workers.  Drawing on an additional decade of data, a number of recent contributions reject this consensus to conclude that (1) the rise in wage inequality was an ""episodic"" event of the first-half of the 1980s rather than a secular phenomenon, (2) this rise was largely caused by a falling minimum wage rather than by supply and demand factors; and (3) rising residual wage inequality since the mid-1980s is explained by confounding effects of labor force composition rather than true increases in inequality within detailed demographic groups.  We reexamine these claims using detailed data from the Current Population Survey and find only limited support.  Although the growth of overall inequality in the U.S.  slowed in the 1990s, upper tail inequality rose almost as rapidly during the 1990s as during the 1980s.  A decomposition applied to the CPS data reveals large and persistent rise in within-group earnings inequality over the past several decades, controlling for changes in labor force composition.  While changes in the minimum wage can potentially account for much of the movement in lower tail earnings inequality, strong time series correlations of the evolution of the real minimum wage and upper tail wage inequality raise questions concerning the causal interpretation of such relationships.  We also find that changes in the college/high school wage premium appear to be well captured by standard models emphasizing rapid secular growth in the relative demand for skills and fluctuations in the rate of growth of the relative supply of college workers--though these models do not accurately predict the slowdown in the growth of the college/high-school gap during the 1990s.  We conclude that these patterns are not adequately explained by either a 'unicausal' skill-biased technical change explanation or a revisionist hypothesis focused primarily on minimum wages and mechanical labor force compositional effects.  We speculate that these puzzles can be partially reconciled by a modified version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis that generates a polarization of skill demands""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Do health sector reforms have their intended impacts ? the World Bank's Health VIII Project in Gansu Province, China",Finance,"""The literature contains few impact evaluations of health sector reforms, especially those involving broad and simultaneous changes on both the demand and supply sides of the sector.  This paper reports the results of a World Bank-funded health sector reform project in China known as Health VIII.  On the supply-side, the project combined infrastructure investments (especially at the township level) with improved planning and management, including a referral system between township health centers and county hospitals, and interventions aimed at improving the effectiveness and quality of care, including the introduction of clinical protocols and essential drug lists.  On the demand-side, the project sought to resurrect community health insurance, and to introduce a safety net for the very poor to provide them with financial assistance with their health care expenses.  The evaluation reported here concerns just one of the project's seven provinces, namely Gansu, the reason being that no suitable data are available to undertake a rigorous evaluation in all provinces.  This paper makes use of a panel dataset collected for quite another purpose but whose timing (just around the time the project started and four years later) and location (covering both project and non-project counties) makes it well-suited to the task.  The paper compares estimates obtained using a variety of different estimators, including na&iuml;ve single differences (before and after, and with and without the project), and differences-in-differences, adjusting for heterogeneity through both regression and matching methods.  The results suggest that it makes a difference to the estimated impact of Health VIII which estimator is used, with the na&iuml;ve single differences producing often markedly different estimates from the preferred approach of combining difference-in-differences with matching.  The results further suggest that Health VIII has been mostly successful in its goals.  The preferred estimator suggests that the project reduced illness among children, improved self-assessed health, and increased doctor visits among the population in general, and reduced the incidence of catastrophic health spending, defined as annual spending in excess of 10 percent of annual per capita income.  But the project appears to have increased the development and use of high-level facilities, hastened the demise of the village clinic, and may have reduced immunization rates.

Standing on academic shoulders measuring scientific influence in universities /,Economic theory,"""This article measures scientific influence by means of citations to academic papers.  The data source is the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI); the scientific institutions included are the top 110 U.S. research universities; the 12 main fields that classify the data cover nearly all of science; and the time period is 1981-1999.  Altogether the database includes 2.4 million papers and 18.8 million citations.  Thus the evidence underlying our findings accounts for much of the basic research conducted in the United States during the last quarter of the 20th century.  This research in turn contributes a significant part of knowledge production in the U.S. during the same period. The citation measure used is the citation probability, which equals actual citations divided by potential citations, and captures average utilization of cited literature by individual citing articles.  The mean citation probability within fields is on the order of 10-5.  Cross-field citation probabilities are one-tenth to one-hundredth as large, or 10-6 to 10-7.  Citations between pairs of citing and cited fields are significant in less than one-fourth of the possible cases.  It follows that citations are largely bounded by field, with corresponding implications for the limits of scientific influence.Cross-field citation probabilities appear to be symmetric for mutually citing fields.  Scientific influence is asymmetric within fields, and occurs primarily from top institutions to those less highly ranked.  Still, there is significant reverse influence on higher-ranked schools.  We also find that top institutions are more often cited by peer institutions than lower-ranked institutions are cited by their peers.  Overall the results suggest that knowledge spillovers in basic science research are important, but are circumscribed by field and by intrinsic relevance.  Perhaps the most important implication of the results are the limits that they seem to impose on the returns to scale in the knowledge production function for basic research, namely the proportion of available knowledge that spills over from one scientist to another""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
Fixed costs and FDI the conflicting effects of productivity shocks /,Economic theory,"""The paper develops a model with lumpy setup costs of new investment, which govern the flows of FDI.  Foreign investment decisions are two-fold: whether to export FDI and, if so, how much.  The first decision is governed by total profitability considerations, whereas the second is governed by marginal profitability considerations.  A positive productivity shock in the host country may, on the one hand, increases the volume of the desired FDI flows to the host country but, on the other hand, somewhat counter-intuitively, lowers the likelihood of the making new FDI flows by the source country, at all.  Every country is potentially both a source for FDI flows to several host countries, and a host for FDI flows from several source countries.  Thus, the model could generate two-way FDI flows, but not all source-host FDI flows get realized.  We employ a sample of 24 OECD countries, over the period 1981-1998.  We observe many pairs of countries with no FDI flows between them.  Zero reported flows could indicate measurement errors, or true zeroes that are due to fixed costs (in situations where they dominate marginal productivity conditions).  Empirical literature on the determinants of FDI flows which uses the Tobit procedure aims at a correction for measurement errors provides nevertheless biased estimates in the presence of fixed costs.  By employing the Heckman selection procedure, we demonstrate how to get unbiased estimates of the fixed-costs effects on FDI flows.  Controlling for the selection into source-host pairs of countries, and for time and country fixed effects, the paper sheds light on the importance of several covariates, such as income per capita, education, and financial risk ratings as key determinants of volume of FDI flows.  While the coefficients of both the source- and host-country average years of schooling are positive and significant in the flow equation, the magnitude of the source country coefficient is more than twice that of the host country.  That is, the richer the source country is relative to the host country, the larger are the FDI flows which occur between them""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
The structure of early care and education in the United States historical evolution and international comparisons /,Economic theory,"""Most European governments have universal, consolidated, education-based ECE programs that are available from early in the morning to late in the evening throughout the year.  European ECE programs are uniformly of high quality, generally last at least three years, and are funded to serve all children.  The US ECE system is composed of three separate programs (Head Start, Pre-Kindergarten (Pre-K) and the child care voucher program) targeted to low-income children.  With a few notable exceptions, US ECE programs are funded to serve less than half of the eligible children.  US ECE programs developed quite separately.  They have different goals, different funding sources, different administrations and policies, and generally last for an academic year or less.  Pre-K and Head Start operate only 3 to 6 hours a day and are open only during the academic year.  The average quality of US ECE programs is generally much lower than the average quality of European ECE programs.  Further, the quality of US ECE programs varies widely even within local areas.  Although the US has greatly increased expenditures on ECE, US governments pay only 40% of the costs of ECE, while European governments pay 70% to 90% of the costs of ECE.  None of the major US ECE programs simultaneously provides work supports for parents, child development opportunities for children and preparation for school for low-income children.  The evidence suggests that the US ECE system is neither efficient nor equitable.  Consolidation of funding and administration of current US ECE programs could substantially lower transaction costs for parents and provide more stable care arrangements for children.  Increased funding could improve the quality of existing programs, extend hours and months of operation, and make care available to all eligible families.  Both the evaluation literature and the European experience suggest that such a consolidated, well-funded system could be successful in preparing poor children for school.  Further, the benefits of such a program could well exceed the costs since it is precisely low-income children that benefit most from stable, high-quality ECE.  However, such a targeted program will have neither the positive peer group effects nor the social-integration benefits of universal ECE programs""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site."
"Export led growth, pro-poor or not? evidence from Madagascar's textile and apparel industry",Finance,"""Madagascar's textile and apparel industry has been among the fastest growing in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Fueled by low labor costs, a fairly productive labor force, and preferential access to industrial countries, Madagascar's exports of textile and apparel products grew from about US$45 million in 1990 to almost half a billion in 2001.  The impact of this export surge has been large in terms of employment and wages, but less so in terms of poverty reduction.  To address the concern of whether the poor benefit and to what extent, the author follows a new approach to identify the beneficiaries of globalization and to quantify the benefits at the household level, so as to understand which segments of the population benefit most and which, if any, are marginalized.  The analysis focuses on the labor market channel which has been recognized as the main transmission between economic growth and poverty.  The methodology uses household level data and combines the wage premium literature with matching methods.  The results point to a strong variation in the distribution of the benefits from export growth with skilled workers and urban areas benefiting most.  From a poverty perspective, export-led growth in the textile and apparel sector has only a small effect on overall poverty.  This study points to two reasons for this.  First, a large majority of the poor are unable to enjoy the new employment opportunities, given their lack of skills sought by the expanding textile and apparel export industry.  Second, most of the poor reside in rural areas where the employment effect is small.  The results indicate that the effects of an increase in exports of textiles for poverty reduction are felt only in urban areas, mostly through job creation.  Some of the urban poor are good candidates for finding employment in the expanding sector.  But the urban poor are likely to find employment only in unskilled jobs.  Given that unskilled wages are kept low by a large reserve labor sector, the gains are limited, and the overall impact on poverty is small.  More generally, the results of this study suggest that two factors are required if export-led economic growth is to significantly reduce poverty.  First, growth and job creation must not be restricted to a few geographic areas but need to reach areas where the majority of the poor live.  Second, poor people must be assisted in obtaining the skills sought by expanding industries. ""--World Bank web site."

Half a century.,Slavery in the United States,"At the beginning of her autobiography, Jane Swisshelm announces that she intends to show the relationship of faith to the antislavery struggle, to record incidents characteristic of slavery, to provide an inside look at hospitals during the Civil War, to look at the conditions giving rise to the nineteenth-century struggle for women's rights, and to demonstrate, through her own life, the ""mutability of human character."" After her father's death in 1823, she helped support her family through hard work and teaching school. Her marriage in 1836 to James Swisshelm, a Methodist farmer's son, resulted in continual conflict with her husband's family, who sought to convert her to their own beliefs. After a few years in Louisville, Kentucky, where Swisshelm observed slavery first-hand, she left her husband to nurse her mother in Pittsburgh. She wrote several articles for the antislavery Spirit of Liberty and the Pittsburgh Commercial Journal, then in 1848 started her own anti-slavery newspaper, the Pittsburg Saturday Visiter [sic]. Her views on slavery, women's issues, and the Mexican- American War soon attracted a national readership. In 1856 she started another abolitionist paper, the Democrat, and began to lecture frequently on slavery and the legal disabilities of women. She opposed those who advocated leniency for the leaders of the 1862 Sioux uprising, and took her cause to Washington, D.C., on the advice of state officials. While there she secured a position nursing wounded Union soldiers and raising supplies for their benefit. Her narrative ends with her discharge and retirement to an old log block house on ten acres of her husband's family holdings."

"A new home--who'll follow? or, Glimpses of western life.",Fiction,"Caroline Matilda (Stansbury) Kirkland (1801-1864) was a middle-class white woman with a literary bent who moved with her husband and children to the woods of Michigan in the mid-1830s to settle a newly-planned village. In this book, first published in 1839, she offers what she claims to be ""an honest portraiture of rural life in a new country"" (p. 5). Through a series of vignettes and anecdotes strung loosely into a narrative, Kirkland brings to life the social and material culture of a community on what was perceived as the frontier, presenting her experiences with a sense of ironic amusement. She reveals much about social life, social roles and behavior, especially among women. She describes the business of settlement, including how land was purchased and towns planned, and the haste, confusion, speculation and fraud attendant on such transactions. She comments on the social shifts pioneer life made possible, especially the egalitarianism which poorer migrants claimed as their right in new settlements, and the tensions that resulted as migrants from wealthier classes struggled to maintain and adapt the ways of status and culture they had formerly known. Her narrative also dwells on the details of domestic life, showing how houses were constructed and furnished, depicting the difficulties of housekeeping in crudely-built settlements, and the physical challenges of disease, accidents, bad roads, and the exhausting labor of deforestation and new farming. For all its light-hearted tone, Kirkland's book suggests much about how human communities bound together by neighborhood and necessity began to coalesce in a challenging and drastically changing land."
